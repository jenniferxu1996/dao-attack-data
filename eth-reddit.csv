"Everyone crypto-coin essentially is a test or kind of an experiment and with each failure comes knowledge and a learning tool for the next new code to be written.

"I would not call it a ""loophole"" in the contract. It was a vulnerability in the code that a couple people had noticed and talked about online (so it isn't certain the the attacker actually discovered it or simply tried it out after reading about it). The attacker exploited that vulnerability.",t3_4oxxu6,stickySez
"First off, the letter is a fake, in my opinion. Formation of a contract requires the intent to enter into a legal relationship with another party. Additionally, what jurisdiction is going to take this case? Given that, what jurisdiction has the power to enforce specific performance of a decentralized software network? If this person takes legal action he/she/it would (1) out himself, herself, itself to (2) maybe win specific performance of a contract from (3) everyone and no one at the same time (decentralized Ethereum network). Additionally, a contract needs consideration (promise to perform in exchange for a promise or promise to deliver benefit in exchange for a promise). What consideration did the Hacker offer/give to the DAO? I'm no tech expert, but my guess is a court would find insufficient consideration to enforce the contract. Let's say some jurisdiction lucky enough to host this hacker's case grants expectation damages, the amount of money the hacker could have gotten if the contract were performed as promised. Against whom will the court award these damages? Not me.",t3_4oofb2,molokomoloko

"The DDoS threat will be dealt with if it materializes. At current stage there is a consensus for a SF because the majority in the community seem to understand that ""No action is not an option.""

"Thats not the case. I would see it like this: Right now we have one huge mistake which could put 12% of all ether into the control of a few attackers, while the network and the community is still small. So yes i would say a SF or HF is totally reasonable as we are small and can still do that. Ethereum will reach a point some day where this wont be possible, but most likely it will not be 12% of all ether being at stake anymore. In the future if somebody makes a huge mistake and looses 150M, that might very well be just 0.1% of all ether, rather than 12%. So yes i'd say it is reasonable and still very possible, that doesn't mean this will be now forever like this.",t3_4q3nby,frozeman

"Or spreads misinformation to validate his opinions. Pretending the ETH Foundation has the same power as everyone else? You can find post where they talk about directing development of the client. They also fund that development. Their blog is very influential. This is known too but in this instance want to pretend otherwise because they used to to advertise the DAO helping them get that 150 m that they lose because everyone involved was negligent. And the fastest solution to the problem, is letting people deal with the consequences of their poorly made decisions. Because there is literally no justification other contracts should not be saved but this one should. This is just more bad points being made without actual points but dressing it up like is a neutral article to debunk myths. But its just statements with no evidence to actually back up the claims.",t3_4q3nby,whatthefuckareyouona
"I wrote ""technical the same power"", but i agree the foundation has a greater outreach. Concerning the foundations involvement in the DAO, every curator was asked by slock.it directly and was chosen because of its role in the community, we all agreed to help out personally, without the consent of the foundation. By the time, nobody thought this would get that big, nor fail. I just accepted a side task from my former college christoph jentzsch, who did all the ethereum chain tests before, and which i thought will be a small task to verify identities of proposal and thats it. The foundation NEVER put itself behind it legally, nor agreed to any role. We accepted that task personally, we just happened to be in the foundation too. Another note i would like to make, is that many of the curators don't even owned any DAO tokens themselves and i'm sure nobody had more than a few % of their ether in that project. Nobody in this group bet all on the DAO and wanted to switch sooner or later to serve the DAO, but surely everybody wanted to support a project which could have greatly helped all kind of blockchain projects, especially IOT. And concerning your point: ""This is just more bad points being made without actual points but dressing it up like is a neutral article to debunk myths."" I happend to be in almost all channels which want to help the DAO currently and have a deep insight in what happened and what is being done to help. I put that article there because i see so much half knowledge floating around. This is not the fault of the journalist or readers, its because this topic is hard, even for the once deeply involved as smart contracts can be far more complex than what the developer who build it can forsee. As it currently stands the SF is the only viable option to get the ether back (except the Hardfork). Doing nothing will damage a lot of people, may draw legal attention to people involved and will surely have a long lasting negative effect on the whole project.",t3_4q3nby,frozeman

"Very well articulated Fabian. Thanks for that. So My understanding is.....either way the DAO holders get 100% of their funds back and the scam artist gets nothing. It's obvious from a laymen perspective that the HF is cleanest and easiest for everyone other than a small minority of 'purists' that are whipping up a lot of hysteria about how catastrophic it would all be, when in fact it would be a simple fix that would not materially affect hardly anything...other than a few egos of course!",t3_4q3nby,ethereum-rules
"DAO holders scammed the entire community to get their high risk investment funds back while someone executing a contract as written got bullied out of their earnings. Congratulations on going from one of the best crypto with smart contracts to nothing more but a scam coin where contracts don't matter and any bad investments to an influential enough population are reversed. There is literally nothing positive about ethereum anymore and it has to be the most excellent example of what to avoid in crypto. There are no rational reasons to undo the entire point of contracts, and this subreddit is filled with nothing but shills trying to get their poor investment back.

"While I think Rholang is an exciting project, I think it's a bit irresponsible to claim that it ""nullifies"" the DAO bug. It's still entirely possible to write a Rholang version of the bug. The hope is that writing the types will force you to ""think about the problem twice"", and perhaps reduce the chance that you'll miss it twice. This is a hypothesis worth testing, but it's far from the only approach, and at the end of the day, you still have to write the correct code. It's also worth noting that the contract presented in the paper has other problems if left with the current implementation. For instance, a public channel such as  getBalance  is inherently vulnerable to DoS attacks. While this is just a toy example, it illustrates the difficulty of writing correct code: any approach will have strengths, but it will also introduce new weaknesses.",t3_4r3jyd,peterborah
"This is indeed just a toy example. A full implementation will have safeguards against DoS, and other, attacks. The DoS potential in this illustration is not unique or newly introduced by Rholang. The point here is that Rholang would do more than make you look at the problem twice. The compiler itself would detect deviation from the defined type, even if the programmer himself missed the error in his code, and prevent the contract from existing.",t3_4r3jyd,Elokane
"The DoS potential in this illustration is not unique or newly introduced by Rholang. If the comparison is to Ethereum and Solidity, then yes, it is. Contracts are guaranteed to receive their messages on the EVM, so the malicious listener DoS I was referring to is impossible. The point here is that Rholang would do more than make you look at the problem twice. The compiler itself would detect deviation from the defined type, even if the programmer himself missed the error in his code, and prevent the contract from existing. Only if you get the type right, which just moves the potential location of the bug from the code to the type. It may be easier to notice some bugs at the type level, but it still ultimately requires getting it right.",t3_4r3jyd,peterborah
"Agreed. The level of complexity at the type level is dramatically simpler. In the case of the DAO bug, the type fits on one line. You can easily where the race would occur in that line. So, it's like standing on a hill and looking down on the town and comparing the town to a map. You can see if the town matches the map much easier that way than if you're down in the streets trying to build some intuition about where things are in the town. Moreover, today code doesn't occur in a vacuum. Code is a social phenomenon. We code together. i'm going to be motivated to get my types right to mesh with your types, and my neighbor's types, etc. So, it's really a web of intuitions about the correct functioning of contracts expressed at the type level that begins to exert a considerable pressure on the code.",t3_4r3jyd,leithaus
Code is first and foremost an expression of intent. Now the question is how unambiguous or focused can I express my intent as code. And are other people able to use my code in ways I did not intent.

"I would like to thank both FaceDeer, DeviateFish_ and everyone else for the contributions on what they have learned. I believe it is important to get all sides of this in order to move forward. As I have previously stated, I am pro-fork in this instance.  But I would like to share that for the first several weeks after the hack I was not.  The immutability asset that a blockchain possesses is extremely valuable, more valuable than the DAO theft of this magnitude IMO.  What troubled me the most was the default decision to do nothing and allow ourselves to make a major part of our development team work on coding that wasn’t solving real world problems.  As far as we know, Devcon2 would have had presentations still working on solutions for theDAO rather than what was presented.  And the fact that it wasn’t further codifies the belief that the HF was the correct path.  What I think is easily negated is the thought of living in the alternative path this community would have taken had we not HF. Hopefully,  the lessoned learned from this fiasco will give us the tools we need to better overcome these scenarios.  Next time there will be more resistance towards a HF, that has been learned.  But it took these lessons from theDAO to learn that, and because of this, I will never regret the decision to support the HF for theDAO.",t3_556j4p,_N0rth_
"I learned a lot. Some of it good, some of it bad. First the bad. I learned that a very large portion of Ethereum holders and users don't actually  understand  Ethereum or the things that it's used for. Even now, with the lessons of TheDAO only months old, people are throwing millions of dollars into ICOs that can be described as dubious at best. I learned that the Ethereum community is not a special idealistic group free from human nature. When an irreconcilable difference arose and  money  was on the line it almost immediately turned into an all-out war of internet rage. Us versus them, no holds barred and no reasonable argument considered. People trying to talk it out got drowned in the noise. I learned that these divisions exist even among the devs, and that  they  learned about this from the DAO fallout as well. Kind of surprising they'd never seriously considered this philosophical aspect of Ethereum's design despite it being prominently advertised. And I learned that you can 80%-attack an Ethereum chain to insert an arbitrary invalid state transition into it. Something to keep in mind when developing for Ethereum going forward. But there was also some good things I learned. I learned that even when it seems like the whole world has turned against a minority blockchain share, it's actually possible for them to carry on with a viable chain after forking. The majority  can't  just steamroller the minority view and consensus actually is important. I learned that even when there's a perfect storm that brings all the possible pressure to bear against idealists to compromise their values, there's a surprising number who still won't. I think this will greatly reduce the chances of a fork like this happening again. I learned that even in the midst of all that raging nobody launched 51% attacks or other major ""assaults"" against the minority they disagreed with. Not actually sure what this says, it could be a principled stand or it could be a recognition that there's no economic benefit to be had from it, but it was a fear that turned out to be allayed in this particular case. And I learned that eventually the rage fades. Kinda. It's still pretty rough being anti-fork here, and some ETC supporters have gone off the deep end as well, but I've never hidden my views and I'm not dead yet. Here's hoping that in the long run everyone gets what they want and the division becomes irrelevant. Edit: Oh, I forgot one of the best things learned incidentally as a result of this fiasco. Ethereum is naturally resistant to transaction censorship. Before going to the hard fork the devs attempted a ""soft fork"" that would have rejected transactions involving TheDAO funds, essentially making that Ether useless, but it would have opened up a DoS vulnerability far worse than the ones that were recently used against Geth. This is inherent in how Ethereum works, so it was shown that this sort of censorship is impractical in the general case not just with TheDAO or the particular implementation they came up with. That was a really nice hope spot.",t3_556j4p,FaceDeer
How would it be possible to achieve this?  Can't a hard fork by nature implement arbitrary code to remove this property of the system?,t3_556j4p,imaginative_investor
"The idea is, instead of there being just one hard fork, you're forcing that the minority chain also hard fork. This increases the difficulty of successfully maintaining a minority chain, potentially to unreasonable levels. It's a pretty underhanded tactic.",t3_556j4p,DeviateFish_
"I learned that some people are more interested in dogmatic principles than in actual development. That some people can spend hours, days and months discussing about why is so important to hold to those principles but not even one second to develop a iota. And It confirmed how important good governance systems are for anything the human being builds.",t3_556j4p,aribolab
"I learned how utterly centralized a totally decentralized system like The DAO can be. Curators, dao hub forum admins, consider.it admin, very few people 'changing' the DOA source code, the soft fork, no soft fork, the hard fork. At every turn, nearly every decision was centralized in a very few number of people. I believe in a fully decentralized future, but my God, is it ever going to be hard.

"I learned that while Ethereum is strong against a 51% attack in terms of Proof-of-Work, it is surprisingly trivial (by comparison) to execute a 51% attack on the social level. I learned all sorts of things about incentives, especially as they relate to  Proof-of-Work systems . I also learned the power of defaults, and how those who control them wield more influence over the direction of the ecosystem, despite any active voting or community consensus. I also learned that for some aspects of the proof-of-work world, agreement among a small set of powerful users is infinitely more important than the choice or options themselves. I learned that Ethereum, contrary to its marketing, is not the result of idealism, and that when push comes to shove, ideology is quickly sacrificed. Despite, of course, there existing a solution (one that was demonstrated and proven, mind you) that would have satisfied both of the competing ideologies--though not without risk. I learned that to the majority of the vocal community, being right is far more important than doing the right thing... More important, even, than rational discussion. I learned that many of the most ""respected"" developers don't understand basic programming concepts, and are also readily willing to throw their peers under the bus rather than admit their own lack of skill or knowledge. I also learned that many of them wrote contracts without ever fully reading the documentation of the language they were writing in. I learned many things, but above all, I learned that politics and a two-party system is just as much of a problem for Ethereum as it is for America.",t3_556j4p,DeviateFish_
"Comments that are critical about the way things were handled get immediately downvoted by the moon kid brigade. Reminds me of the way anyone critical of the hard fork was immediately pushed aside as conspiring against Ethereum, being a Bitcoin maximalist, a troll, or having no morals in supporting theft.

"The market reacts to the bad and to the good publicity. If the hacker gets away with stolen Ethers and investors lose their investment, then this will be a topic to discuss for many months. Media will recall it for long time and that will be influencing the price of Ether. If the hard fork helps to stop the hacker and investors get back their invested Ethers, then the story will have a good side to sell to the media.

In contrary, if investors win their ETH back they would invest ETH based startups accelerating the growth of ETH marketshare faster.

"This is not true: things can still be censored by miner collusion. It's just expensive to do so, especially in a situation where the soft fork ""wants"" some specific code to be called exactly zero times. A milder form of censorship could be much easier to execute: e.g. prevent some specific code to be called unless some given amount of gas has been spent (in other words, blacklist a contract, but stop checking the blacklist past a certain threshold of gas). That could be easy to implement, and it would let miners impose higher costs on contracts they dislike. And the chance of DoS would be minimal.",t3_4qedj2,giact

The people who decided to cancel the soft fork had fore knowledge that the soft fork was being cancelled before the miners, traders, eth holders did.

It's simpler than that in my view. People wanted their money back from their failed investment so they pushed the fork.

If the market chooses the original chain and it becomes economically dominant, it's the regular people who steadfastly hold ETH that will be the new victims as the market devalues the hard forked chain. While everyone seemed to be on their high horse proclaiming the 'morality' of the hard fork, few seemed to give much thought to who will actually end up the real victims in the end once DAO holders cashed in those unconditional refunds with nothing preventing them dumping them right on top the very people who supported the fork to allow them their money back.

"What's interesting here is that splitting the chain created wealth (ETC and ETH market cap larger than pre-fork) and transferred wealth from ETH to ETC.  So while DAO investors got most of their money back, the DAO thief wins too because his/her BTC are still worth something. You have to ask the question whether the fork was really necessary.  We'll never know what the price of Ethereum would have been had the fork not happened, but with ETH price at the $10 level and sinking, it's reasonable to assume that the pre and post fork prices might not be that different. Of course, the hacker gets less because ETC is worth less than ETH, but even that trend seems to be changing.  Latest pump to ETC has it approaching $3 again.  So if the objective was to deny the thief the financial rewards of their larceny, that doesn't appear to have worked because the heist is still worth millions. Perhaps we had to go through this so we could understand the ramifications of forking.  I'm sure the BTC community is looking long and hard at the Ethereum experience when deciding whether to increase block size and how to implement. For the record, I'm long ETH for the foreseeable future because the core developers have backed it and most of the Dapps are being developed to use it.  The exchanges are agnostic - they just want to make money on transaction fees and with ETC trading volume exceeding that of ETH, why not list it? If we had to do it all over again, my vote would have been not to fork.  It would have been better to focus  on coding Dapps better (so the don't get hacked), developing new Dapps to increase the utility of the blockchain, attracting new investors and tracking down the DAO thief or at least make his/her life difficult.",t3_4vpp48,solarisbetter

It's time for everyone who's stuck on the DAO narrative to either drop it and move on, or ignore eth altogether and find someplace else to put the energy. ETC is not going to be the winner - think we can all agree on that at this point.",t3_61efck,bitcoinfan87

"Let me clarify a bit. The 15th of July is the earliest deadline for the cleanest hard fork possible. If done by that date then the hard fork spec can be as simple as: Move all ETH from all contracts whose ultimate ancestor is  0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413  and their  extraBalance  back to  0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413 . Replace  0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413  code with a simple refund contract (TBD). That contract would have a refund() function for DTH to call.  Once called a refund proportional to the DAO tokens held in both the main DAO and in all (statically enumerated) child DAOs, except the dark DAOs could be claimed by the msg.sender. That's all. Note the above is just a rough approximation and not the actual spec. People are currently working on that spec as we speak. If we wait after the 15th of July, that's when the first split DAO ( https://live.ether.camp/account/d4fe7bc31cedb7bfb8a345f31e668033056b2728 ) will be able to get some money out via a legit split. Once that happens any HF will need to start adding exceptions for all legit splits that take money out. That is why the tweet mentions the 15th of July. The first ""dark"" ETH ( https://live.ether.camp/account/304a554a310c7e546dfe434669c62820b7d83490 ) can go out at the earliest on the 30th of August if there is no counter performed.  That is due to the Dark DAO closing period: 14-Jul-2016 05:34:48 +02:00 + 7 days for a split + 27 days for the creation phase of yet another DAO + 14 days for a proposal to get all the funds out of the new DAO. So in short there are choices even in the deadlines for a HF. But any HF after the 15th of July would end up being more complicated than an HF before the 15th. EDIT: A potential addendum to the spec, but something that needs to be discussed since it would add complexity is to add a list of all accounts who performed a legit split after the attack happened. These people split at a loss since they obtained less tokens in the child DAOs than they should have, had the hack not occured. This list of accounts can be added as an exception to the HF spec and for each account in this list an additional amount of ETH (TBD) would be given. Such a change in the spec would add complexity though so depending on how many actually did do that perhaps a better off-chain solution can be found. All of the above is being discussed with the developers of the clients and all the relevant parties involved.",t3_4qbyob,LefterisJP

If that is not feasible, then the refund procedure should hold back the extra balance and whatever unclaimed tokens to be set aside as reserve for settling these child dao shortfall amounts to be perhaps manually dealt with later. if the logic for the hardfork refund is simply based on simple proportion of total ether holdings, then there will not be any balance left to make whole these child dao token holders subsequently.

The problem with the soft fork is that it would reject certain valid transactions without making the sender pay for the gas.

I believe the hardfork would create a new transaction that moves the funds from the frozen address to a new contract which distributes the funds to dao token holders.,t3_4on3ap,deadhand-
"Do you have a technical understanding of the rollback? I am wondering whether a rollback would also attempt to roll back exchange transactions, which seems impossible or would the rollback only roll back the transactions implicated in the attack?",t3_4on3ap,etheraddict77
"The hardfork which is proposed has only one implication as far as i understand it right now (Griff Green said so too a few minutes ago in a youtube livestream): The bytecode of the TheDAO contract is being replaced by bytecode which will DAO token holders allow to regain control of their ETH. So another contract. It's like TheDAO is being rolled back, but no ETH transactions will be affected at all.",t3_4on3ap,BullBearBabyWhale
There may be some logistic difficulties for the attacker and probably little incentive now that the softfork  and the hardfork are planned to be executed before he can free the diverted ETHs. Once the softfork is in place any activity on the DAO will be impossible. If the softfork does not include other addresses that use the same code as the DAO my understanding is that those contracts will remain vulnerable even after the hardfork. If this is the case I expect that those contracts that use the DAO code and that may have a significant amount of ETHs will be left without founds by their owners before nothing happens. Or maybe the softfork will apply to all those contracts that use the DAO code.,t3_4on3ap,negligible-function

Mining is the only way to acquire ether without identification. Then, using shapeshift to get some DAO tokens. Then, he needs to put some ether into the DAO's reward account to trigger the logic that enables recursion. Then, he'd need to pay lots of gas to make sure his transactions go through quickly.

"Loss of reputation, probable legal troubles, confiscation of stolen ethers and having to still go through the first two. The most major barrier probably for the average user is not having the actual know-how to do it, thankfully, and the actual cost to execute a large scale attack. It all depends on how many DAO tokens you have invested in the DAO now. If you have 10,000 worth of ether invested, you can drain the remaining balance in the timespan of an hour likely or less.

"Well, the problem is two-fold. Very few people support etc because of political reasons. Most people are just buying it because of the massive explosion in popularity. The bummer here is that ETC might very well be a ""burner"" currency. The original DAO hacker still has a huge amount of etc on the other chain, so it could be nothing more than a slow drain of that currency by getting people with a high amount of liquid assets to invest so that the price can be inflated to a point where withdrawal is profitable. The other reason is, the massively weakened network is actually more profitable because it's difficulty hasn't adjusted yet and because for some reason ETC still holds value. Either a large portion of the community believes really strongly in blockchain immutability or it's being manipulated by larger players. Most miners put their rigs together in hope of profit rather than the thrill of being part of the chain, if you're a miner who has invested heavily in hardware you owe it to yourself to get your money's worth, which has lead to the current catch-22 situation. Miners were initially bought into the scheme because ETC had greater value than the effort was to mine it,possibly seeded by an external actor, maybe even one affiliated with the hacker in some way, thus ETC was more profitable than ETH. Leading to a situation where enough miners jumped ship so the sheer hashpower of said  is keeping the price of ETC afloat. This is most likely a temporary situation, as the profitability of mining ETC shrinks many miners will switch back to the more reliable currency, unless they're held back by their political stance. Either way, ETC is currently driven mainly by greed, (And that's not a bad thing - Missing Opportunities feels bad, man.) aswell as some salty folks who were against a hardfork.",t3_4ueieq,keller112

"Do you really believe that? I believe that the reason people are buying into ETH is because it is different than Bitcoin.

"You're saying that if exactly the same thing happens in the future you don't want to fork? Then why does TheDAO get special treatment now? Every situation is it's own situation and should be treated as such. This is a special situation. It is a situation that (1) had a massive amount of money (2) the first attack at this scale that we have seen, with the only clear way to solve via fork (3) the first attack that has a  lot  of contributing factors as to why it happened. Other contracts that had their funds stolen or trapped did not follow best practices, did not have any sort of audit, and did not have even close to the same scope, and in some cases did not learn from past experiences. This is a problem when developing contracts at this stage. This is not to say the developers in those cases are 100% to blame: people also put money in them without doing due diligence and the tools for developers need to be improved. Here is one example: 3 Months Ago, Etherdice's funds got trapped because of how gas was refunded The contract keeps a history of about 100 generations in storage. Processing of the current generation 2118 also includes deleting the archived generation 2019. That was a fairly large one and the deletion process hits the block gas limit before the gas refunds can apply. Requires 3146209 gas, but max gas was 3141592 1 Month Ago GovernMental had 1100 ETH trapped due to the exact same issue. This compiles to code which iterates over the storage locations and deletes them one by one. The list of creditors is so long, that this would require a gas amount of 5057945, but the current maximum gas amount for a transaction is only 4712388. Fun fact! A hard fork actually did rescue Etherdice's funds 😉 : ""Homestead is coming up soon and we can do a new floor gas limit increase (I think that will make quite some people happy in general anyway). I'll put in a PR and cherry-pick to the release candidate today/tomorrow"" - Jeffrey Wilcke of Ethereum Foundation / geth It is a problem whenever someone loses ETH at this point. Regardless of who is to blame, it's a problem. We should do whatever we can to resolve such issues, and prevent such issues from happening again. Sometimes that means a geth developer pushes a commit a bit early to solve the issue. Sometimes that means  opening a donation fund for a guy who lost 7218 ETH due to a Mist/geth/open RPC issue . And sometimes, when it is disastrous enough, that means discussing a fork. I would absolutely give anything to not go through this hellacious and dividing experience again. However we have arrived so all we can do now is try to pick up the pieces, rebuild, and rebuild stronger.  Therefore, we need to work towards building better tools, learning from this mistake, etc. I've spoken about what I think needs to happen so I won't repeat myself so let's assume that this does happen again in a year. Let's say that we make a contract, promote the hell out of it, collectively ignore everything we have learned from this experience. That means developers ignore potential for bugs, quirks or flaws in Solidity, not being prepared for the worst, not implementing any sort of cap or failsafe method. That means researches and auditors ignore (what would now be) known attack vectors. That means that participants and promoters ignore due diligence. That means onlockers and public figures do not ask the hard questions. And we end up in the same spot: a contract with $150M USD gets drained to a malicious person's account. That is different that The DAO. Very, very different. Because, now that this has happened, there is  no reason for it to happen again . If history repeats itself, I will be the first to declare hard forking for The DAO as a massive mistake because we obviously got off too lightly if we didn't learn. However, I have faith in the community, in the leaders, and in developers that we will be more careful and more diligent moving forward. I feel that we will be more careful with or without a fork, and the added benefit of the fork (people getting their funds back) outweighs the potential ""precedent"" it sets. The perceived removal of ""Unstoppable"" utility to the Ethereum network and thus a decrease in value. The ensuing 3.5M ETH dump on the market after scared TDAO holders from the mainstream just want to get out asap and start panic selling These are two large assumptions that I don't see happening. The market will rise with stability. Fork or no fork, the price will increase when the drama and unknowns decrease. Additionally, you do not know what percentage of total Ethereum investors have also invested in The DAO but there are a  lot  of them. You seem to think that The DAO is some little contract that a select few new about. That's not the case. However, you want to know what happens without a fork? The attacker(s) will dump all their stolen ETH on the market. And that is more than 3.5M ETH.",t3_4pd63n,insomniasexx
"If history repeats itself, I will be the first to declare hard forking for The DAO as a massive mistake because we obviously got off too lightly if we didn't learn [...] I have faith in the community, in the leaders, and in developers that we will be more careful and more diligent moving forward But by hard-forking this is exactly what we're telling Smart Contract developers. If you fuck up to this extent, expect a hard fork, so don't worry too much about making sure they're working. You must be aware that a  lot  of people, including this very article, are arguing for a 'hard-fork-happy' Ethereum. In a competition-heavy setting, people tend to cut corners and we need disasters like TheDAO to rein that mentality in. If we just undo this, people aren't going to learn anything and demand the same treatment. With regards to the 'will the hacker or DTH dump or not', this is purely speculation from both sides -- only time will tell. But I know where I'll be placing my bets on how the market reacts once a fork is announced/denied.",t3_4pd63n,Johnny_Dapp
"we need disasters like TheDAO to rein that mentality in. If we just undo this, people aren't going to learn anything and demand the same treatment. I agree that disasters like The DAO rein in that mentality. I disagree that forking mitigates the amount that can and will be learned, and I dont feel that the amount lost by innocent parties offsets the small risk that  some  people have this mentality. And I think that may be the point that we actually disagree on at the core. I do understand your point and where you are coming from. I will even admit that perhaps I am too idealistic on this point and the reality may fall somewhere in the middle. I truly hope and will do whatever I can to make sure developers don't fall into a mindset of  its okay if you fuck up . In the end, I'm just one person and it will ultimately be the developers, and larger community keeping a diligent eye on these developers. I really need to get some work done before bed, but I'd like to say thank you for sharing your views and having this discussion and remaining civil. I hope you have a good night. I talked more about why I disagree with the argument that people must lose $150M in order to learn a lesson here, if anyone isn't sick of my typing.",t3_4pd63n,insomniasexx
"The civility is mutually appreciated, thank you. Fair enough if you have work to do; so do I. I would leave one final point. Let's focus on what we agree on: We agree that if a HF happens, there is likely to be SOME downside of this encouraging people to be less responsible. Yes, it doesn't offset the damage to innocents, but: Non DTH did not contribute to this at all, and do not benefit from the HF in any way A hard fork will unfairly benefit DTH at the expense of non DTH",t3_4pd63n,Johnny_Dapp
"I don't agree that non DTH would not benefit. I put money in to the DAO specifically to help build the Ethereum ecosystem. That money will still go to that if I get it back. I know for sure I'm not the only one (I also put in an amount I was perfectly comfortable losing and if I don't get it back for whatever reason it really isn't that big a deal to me). If I get that money back this time it's going directly towards increasing Ethereum security, be it bug bounties or otherwise, I'm pledging all of that to the ecosystem (and more! I'd love a more clearly ""altruistic"" DAO with the express aim of building the ecosystem without necessarily needing direct profit, and would put more money into that than I did into theDAO. I put altruistic in quotes because I believe that doing so will raise the value of Ether far more than the amount spent to do it so it's also selfish). $150 million in the hands of holders, investors, speculators, builders in the ecosystem is GREAT for every ETH holder. In the hands of thieves it is a giant unknown at best and a potential destruction at worst. Just as you say there will be damage if we do a fork, I say there will be massive damage to reputation if we let this happen and we could have stopped it. Make no mistake doing nothing is also a choice and it's also a moral decision. If it wasn't possible things would be different but it IS possible. I truly believe the damage would be mitigated by the good press and the draw of seeing a community thwart an attacker. I truly believe the damage would be mitigated and outweighed by discouraging attacks. I also think we shouldn't be hardforking regularly and the complete meltdown caused by even discussing it demonstrates it will only get more difficult from here if it happens. What I cannot abide is us doing nothing about the thief. Slippery slope arguments work both ways and letting a thief steal when we could have stopped them is as slippery as a slope can get this early on. I truly believe that whatever can be done should be done to rectify this and would sacrifice my own ETH spent on theDAO in order to get it back for others. I really do think it's that important for maintaining the momentum and reputation of Ethereum.",t3_4pd63n,fullmatches
"Agree, i think a lot of people forget that a lot of people put money in the DAO specifically to help build the Ethereum ecosystem. And if we do nothing a big part of that investment or ''believers money'' will be gone. I think it's not clever to lose this money, because of a theft. Ethereum is a young blockchain, and we have the power to do the good thing.",t3_4pd63n,Mikeinthehouse
"Keep in mind the damage done by the thief is not just reputational, but when Ethereum moves to Proof of Stake he'll own 6% or whatever of the Stake.  Not enough to tamper with consensus yet, but a decent start toward it.",t3_4pd63n,SkyMarshal
"I understand that the money in the DAO was supposed to go to helping the Ethereum ecosystem, and that is commendable. However, it was fundamentally a speculative investment; you sent Ether to the DAO in the hopes of eventual profit in one way or another. I find it oddly coincidental that the debate is now shifting towards the idea that the funds, if lost, would be a detriment to the Ethereum ecosystem. That's not to dismiss the original intention, but now we're  supposed to take your word that the majority of post-bailout DTH will be investing in similar ""Pro Ether"" projects as opposed to getting out of the system asap? I don't buy that for a second.",t3_4pd63n,Johnny_Dapp

"As a smart contract developer, the thought of causing a disaster like this is an absolute nightmare, and I'm pretty sure most other devs feel the same, whether this one gets fixed by a fork or not. Reasons we feel this way include: We believe in the platform and don't want to damage it. We care about our reputations. We're building apps we hope people will like, and don't want to hurt the friendly people using our stuff. The stress of needing a global fork to get money back qualifies as ""hurt,"" even if the funds are recovered, which is never guaranteed. Many of us own some ether and would rather its value go up than down.",t3_4pd63n,ItsAConspiracy
"I am also coming to this from a dev point of view. I'm worried about the future culture that we're fostering by implementing the HF. As an SC dev, surely you understand the importance of stressing the immutability of contracts people deploy? If we set a standard that says ""if you deploy a contract and get over 150m USD in that contract, we can do a hardfork if it goes wrong"" - does that not skew the incentive structure?",t3_4pd63n,Johnny_Dapp
"No, I'd say it doesn't skew the incentives, for all the reasons above. I strongly want to avoid epic failure even if other people are able to repair the damage I caused. Even if the money is recovered, TheDAO is dead. That's a failed project, not a happy bailout that keeps the project going. I don't want my projects to fail, my users to regret getting involved, my reputation to be destroyed. If I somehow end up with a $150 million project, I want it to remain a huge success, not turn into a disaster written up in the NYTimes. And if (more likely) my projects stay a lot smaller than that, it's unlikely that any sort of fork would happen anyway.",t3_4pd63n,ItsAConspiracy
"There is a significant difference here, however - there is a rational discussion going on here.  I also suspect that whatever happens with this fork, Ethereum will continue to take over as the #1 coin afterward. That is what censorship does.  When people aren't allowed to debate with each other, they gain no understanding of the other side and they devolve to the sort of petty actions that people like  /u/petertodd  took against  /u/gavinandresen .  That's why I think that  /u/theymos  is by far the most responsible person for the decline of bitcoin. I'm amazed at how there are so many comments here and yet people are presenting points in a logical manner and treating each other with dignity.   /u/Johnny_Dapp  seems to be significantly outnumbered and his views are clearly in the minority, but he still receives upvotes and I haven't yet seen a reply of ""F YOU"" something that calls him a ""shill.""

(Note that there are a few posts here that do engage in calling other people trolls or shills, and I reported those in the hope they will be removed, but they are so few that they are almost unnoticeable) I started posting in this thread to point out why the fork is a good thing, but I'm coming out convinced that no matter what happens, something of enormous significance will have been accomplished - a rational debate that demonstrates that a coin's community can come to a decision and move on afterward.",t3_4pd63n,ProHashing
"The blocksize issue is one issue that is solved, Huh? Sharding  might  reduce blocksize (at a cost),  IF  Casper ever works,  in  the distant future. Nothing is ""solved"" yet!",t3_4pd63n,burn-it-alive-kit
This is the most interesting thing since mt gox... let's hope ethereum survives  it,t3_4ot3z8,TheDashGuy
"Maybe  you  don't know that blocksize is a two-edged sword: the bigger the blocks the bigger the blockchain. The real goal is to keep both small, but have large capacity. Ethereum hasn't actually solved either of these problems. Bitcoin solves them by enforcing a fee market (centralized economical planing). It's a crappy solution, but it's a solution.",t3_4pd63n,burn-it-alive-kit
"Ethereum's pruning reduces the blocksize by about an order of magnitude, and the percentage will improve as time passes. There's another reason for blocksize limits, which is block propagation latency. The bigger the blocks, the longer it takes them to propagate, so if the blocks are too big then you get more forking. That's a bigger problem on Bitcoin since mining a forked block doesn't pay or contribute to security. Ethereum has GHOST, where forked blocks do pay and contribute, and that's why Ethereum has 15-second blocks and can handle higher transaction rates already. Various Bitcoin devs are working on variants of thin blocks, which is another way of solving this problem. Based on actual testing they should be able to handle at least 20MB blocks this way. On Bitcoin, another reason for the current block limit has to do with a nonlinear increase in validation time for purposely large transactions (i.e. DDOS attacks); the XT client adds a limit to prevent this. Ethereum doesn't have the problem, since it doesn't use UTXOs and already has the gas mechanism.",t3_4pd63n,ItsAConspiracy
"that problem must be remarkable enough to inspire a lengthy debate, consideration, and convince the majority that it is necessary. And it helps if the founders were also invested in it, pushing it, and saying it was completely safe from fund loss.",t3_4pd63n,ForkiusMaximus
"Do you really believe that? Ether is a currency. Currency is financial value. People are buying Ether because they believe it will be worth more later. One of the reasons they believe it will be worth more later because they believe in the possibility of smart contracts, blocksize might also factor into it, but the initial investment is financial reasons. Unless they brought Ether specifically to run on some contract(s). Of course believing in smart contracts doesn't really indicate a position on the fork or not. Many people believe in smart contracts more if the network takes action to reverse a major theft. Others will believe in them less if they are left to the control of consensus. Both are opinions and beliefs that we have no way to value. Currently I'm not seeing too many examples of real world smart contract usage. It's a new technology still being adopted and it will take a long time. I suspect in the end many smart contract based systems such as with banks, governments, companies will be private, permissioned and/or hybrid blockchains where there can be a decision to overturn something, but that there will be an immutable record of it. What about Gatecoin, all of the other documented losses? The word whatever suggests we can hard-fork any problem. Why does TheDAO get special treatment? TheDAO should get special treatment because we can give it special treatment. If you have a practical way to give everyone the same treatment I'm all ears. Maybe someone will come up with an anonymous arbitration system. Maybe an impartial AI. But that technology doesn't exist. Making those people suffer won't help me or you. In any case it won't just be TheDAO that is effected, it will be the entire currency and blockchain technologies in general. If could also be you or me in the future if we end up in a similar situation. Maybe we should reverse all the transactions of people who sent money to 0x0 by accident because JavaScript is parsed stupidly, or people who managed to get their money locked in some infinite loop due to an issue. In some extreme case, maybe someone dying of cancer needing money for their medical treatments comes forward as having lost their money in some contract due to an unforeseen issue/bug and the other party of the contract comes forward and says he agrees. And both prove they own the addresses in question. Now it's up to them to convince those miners to fork. There are other possibilities, like the first person is lying about the cancer to gather sympathy. Or no 2nd party shows up to give their side of things. But in order for anything to happen, you have to get consensus. So it's only going to be for issues that effects everyone. It might even be an individual's issue, after all the reputation of the network can effect everyone, it can effect everyone's investment in the network and the willingness of people to use the systems and others like it. You can claim that people should be cautious and invest wisely. But not everyone is going to be a security expert. There will always be new attack vectors invented. Formal verification isn't some magic that makes programs work the way you want, it would help quite a bit but there will still be the potential for unexpected issues. And formal verification isn't approachable for most people, it's founded on mathematics and smart contracts are written by programmers. That would be a system that punished people who are less intelligent. It would be like seeing someone bleeding out with a stab wound on the side of the road and requiring an IQ test before you agree to take them to the hospital, or that they answer a test on proper knife safety. As a person I would prefer to conduct my transactions in a system where I have things like consumer protection for example. Such a system would require some kind of government. Traditional country/state governments or some new blockchain based system, like random anonymous arbiters. Yes, theoretically the government could come along an seize my money. But it in a public blockchain it would be on public record as occurring, in the forked blockchain (or the diff between the old and the new forks). There is also the possibility of pseudo anonymity to prevent the government knowing which transactions are me unless I need them too. Theoretically my government could come and physically arrest me and torture/coerce the keys/passwords out of me on a system they don't control anyway. That wouldn't be on public record. I don't have magic unwavering faith in governments, but it's more likely some shady company/person/hacker will rip me off than the government collude to seize control my assets. Standard governments can rip you off though taxes anyway (unless you are one of those totally antigoverment nut jobs and think tax is some kind of theft). Maybe that's different in another country where a dictator might steal your stuff. Maybe it will be different in the future. But the immutability property of the blockchain would show the evidence that it happend, and what happened. And the ability for people to fork means they could abandon the government chain for a different one (although the government can choose to only accept taxes in one currency and ban the other). Maybe the key thing would be that we just have the  option  of another system. And that could be enough to help ensure the main standard one(s) are managed correctly. If the entire government was running on a blockchain, and people objected to them to a massive extent, everyone could agree to fork the government chain, rehold an election and keep going. And what about the people who will massively lose out if a hard-fork happens? And who will lose out massively? The Ethereum network is mated to a currency Ether, that's due to fundamental requirements of a pseudonymous network to protect against a sybil attack and pay the people running the network for their power. Ether is a currency, it's a financial value. It's worth what people are willing and able to pay. The decision is being made based on consensus which will give the values of the miners running the network. The people with more computing power and more money to assign. The people who will be most effected. Peoples objections are about values and ideology. We can't measure how much of that goes into the value of a currency. At least not without more data and given the current environment some kind of survey wouldn't be impartial. The only way we will be able to get that data will be to see the outcome. Since Ether is financial value, mining consensus is backed by wealth. It will end up being a financial decision. The worst outcome will be your values about of the network are not kept (or specifically your values are not represented by the consensus community), but the outcome is most likely to be the financially best one due to the consensus (although it's not guaranteed). You would probably have more money than if the other decision was made so you can sell and leave if it's that important (although I would wait for a recovery time).",t3_4pd63n,H3g3m0n
"I agree with your first parts, my point is this article doesn't really ""get"" Ethereum if they think most people care more about the block-size debate than Smart Contracts. But it would be on public record as occurring. Not if you hard-fork it wont. Look, if you want regulation, fine, build build it into the contracts themselves. You can have different regulatory structures within contracts -- but don't risk the entire system by creating a single regulatory point of failure. There's no way Ethereum will become a 'World Computer' if one jurisdiction rules over it. EDIT: The post I originally replied to was much shorter and has been edited to add more content. Replying: TheDAO should get special treatment because we can give it special treatment What kind of argument is that? I'm asking what the principle here is? Are we just assuming mob mentality is the new consensus mechanism? Whoever promises the most freebies, has the most charismatic leader, best propaganda campaign, etc? That's what we're trying to get away from. You can claim that people should be cautious and invest wisely. But not everyone is going to be a security expert. I don't understand how that follows. Of course not everyone is a security expert, which is why they should not invest in shit they don't understand. If people understood this TheDAOsaster wouldn't have happened. If we go ahead and hard fork that and undo this, people are just going to not learn a thing and, as you put it, 'form a consensus' whenever  anything  goes wrong. There  has  to be a principle for hard forking. If not, by your logic, as long as the majority agree, then it's OK to hard fork for anything. We need to foster a culture where it's NOT okay, or we'll start seeing really stupid shit getting hard-forked. Why don't we hard fork and magic-in a 50M ETH to this charity that says it will save starving kids in Africa? Who would be against that? Why hard-fork a fund for the next solar roadways, or TheDAO? We can do anything with no consequences, yay! The point is: the masses don't understand inflation and money supply, so why should they get to decide what the consensus is?",t3_4pd63n,Johnny_Dapp
"Not if you hard-fork it wont. A hard fork creates a new separate blockchain, it won't magically alter the original. People must specifically update their software to run the new algorithm to convert to the new chain. People can archive the chain prior to the fork (or better yet, the differences). Although using it as proof might be an issue if there is no way to validate a copy. Soft forks might actually be the worse option as far as permanent records go, my understanding is it just requires mining consensus to do things like suppress transactions and that choice (or specifically lack of it) would end up propagating to the nodes since it never actually ends up in the blockchain. But those are technical issues. Maybe we need to make sure that hard forking automatically keeps a copy (of diff) of the original on the clients side Might need to embed the hash of the unforked chain in the new fork as proof that the offline copies are correct. Or that hardforking doesn't alter the cloned contents, but adds new stuff to the top to override the state. Maybe we can keep copies of the rejected consensus decisions (or at least the ones with larger significant numbers), that would prevent miner suppression. If you do alter the blockchain algorithms, that change will be reflected in the code that with a decent SCM we will have a history of. Of course nothing can enforce that since hardforking changes the software. Look, if you want regulation, fine, build build it into the contracts themselves. You can have different regulatory structures within contracts -- but don't risk the entire system by creating a single regulatory point of failure. There's no way Ethereum will become a 'World Computer' if one jurisdiction rules over it. But what do you do if the regulation is the bit with a problem. TheDAO had regulation built into it, it was the ability for people to fork off their own companies where the bug was. But I agree that the regulation should be built into the contracts when possible. What kind of argument is that? I'm asking what the principle here is? Are we just assuming mob mentality is the new consensus mechanism? Your on a planet with 7.1+ billion people. 'mob mentality' has always been the consensus mechanism. Not forking is still a decision, it would also be based on mob mentality. The only decision that isn't, would be a split chain. But that 'unaltered' chain itself would still be subject to 'mob mentality', since it's the mob that will decide if they value it or not. Also if it did gain value, it could still be over taken by others who are interested in it just for financial reasons rather than the values and would favour a future fork. Whoever promises the most freebies, has the most charismatic leader, best propaganda campaign, etc? That's what we're trying to get away from. Hopefully not enough miners would be swayed by things like that. But welcome to reality. This is what is happening now, people are arguing for or against the fork. Your talking about your view point and I'm doing the same, that's the propaganda. which is why they should not invest in shit they don't understand. The problem is they have to understand they shouldn't invest in shit they don't understand. They also have to understand that they don't understand. That's still valuing intelligence at the primary attribute for whether or not we provide assistant to people. Many of these people where idiots. But they are also idealists, they saw that DAO as a way to make the world a better place. We also benefited from their fuck up, as now people are going to be aware of the issue. The specific bug in the contract can be fixed. People are discussing formal verification. They have also raised the much larger issue of this fork debate and the values surrounding it. If we go ahead and hard fork that and undo this, people are just going to not learn a thing and, as you put it, 'form a consensus' whenever anything goes wrong. People don't need to be 'punished' to learn a lesson. There not Pavlov's dog, they don't lack the basic ability of communication. And if they really don't learn from everything that happened, with almost having their money stolen, it's unlikely they will if it doesn't get returned. The most you could argue is it's Darwinian evolution at work, but we don't normally go around killing stupid idealists. The other problem is if there is no fork then many other people will learn a lesson from that as well. Don't trust Ethereum and it's community. Blockchains. Smartcontracts. As the communities around will stand by and let your money get stolen. Other people will learn the opposite about how the community is willing to alter the contracts. Either way the fork goes I think people have learned quite a few lessons. There has to be a principle for hard forking. If not, by your logic, as long as the majority agree, then it's OK to hard fork for anything. We need to foster a culture where it's NOT okay, or we'll start seeing really stupid shit getting hard-forked. Forking isn't something that you can just do. It's a hard process to accomplish and it requires everyone to upgrade, be coordinated and so on. Look at all this stuff that has happened here. It could be made easier. More standardised. I agree that there probably should be a set of 'principles' for hard forking. A charter or so on. Undeniable proof for example. Has had a decent amount of time for debate. There could be specific like must involve 'X amount of Ether', although specific probably wouldn't be a good idea (that amount of ether could be worth more or less) But it's not possible to enforce that. You can't put it in code, even if you could hard forking is about running new different code. It would be purely symbolic and up to the consensus if they wish to abandon it. That symbolism might be enough. But it is about values an ideals and a consensus made of purely financially motivated entities would ignore it. We could ignore their fork, but they are the ones with the most money. Why don't we hard fork and magic-in a 50M ETH to this charity that says it will save starving kids in Africa? Who would be against that? Why hard-fork a fund for the next solar roadways, or TheDAO? We can do anything with no consequences, yay! I have been thinking about that since the debate started. And it might not actually be a bad thing. In fact it's possible that it might end up being how economies of the future are run. Right now we are facing the problem of wealth inequality. This will get worse with automation. With AI, eventually no one might work, and no one would need to work. Things like atomically precise manufacturing could allow post-scarcity for regular items, the ability to produce more than people would need. So it could be how we redistribute finite resource like land. Actually it's already happened to some extent. The Ethereum Foundation had it's premined blocks. Money injected into the system at the start. That Ether is earmarked for the development of Ethereum. Developing Ethereum increases the value of the platform and the value of everyone Ether. It would make financial sense to give them more if they needed it to keep developing Ethereum (assuming they where doing a good job). Even if they had an infinite Ether source that wouldn't drastically effect the currency since it would be the amount they actually spend that enters the ecosystem. Of course that's assuming that it isn't misused or hacked. In that case that money injection increased everyone wealth. Maybe injecting money into Africa in some future would increase the worlds 'value' by turning them into productive member of society capable of wealth creation. Solar roadways could increase value too (although not the ones we saw posted around here). It's not unlike the DAO investing in companies. Ethereum is basically a DAO in this sense. The point is: the masses don't understand inflation and money supply, so why should they get to decide what the consensus is? You could try and put 'don't do that' in some forking charter and hope they will follow it. They might not. I think most people understand the basics of inflation. There are plenty of idiots out there but consensus requires the majority. The underlying issue is how do you stop the consensus group as a whole being idiot, TheDAO was like that. Bug aside TheDAO could have tanked because people with no education about the relevant fields made stupid business decisions en mass. I don't have a solution to that. It's worth noting that it's basically one big prediction market, and that there is some scientific evidence for the 'wisdom of crowds'. In the future maybe things could be mathematically modelled, so you can work out if giving resources to starving Africans will pay off. By that point if we have post scarcity we might not be so worried about wealth and it more 'which will help the most'.

"were sold an idea of Unstoppable Smart Contracts Yes, and I invested  in spite of  that 'unstoppability' claim. Though I do not know how common my own position is, it does seem reasonable that I am not alone. It may be the case that people invested in Ethereum for different value propositions, and that the  absolute  immutability of contracts was not the chief selling point for at least a percentage of people. I believe for many people, most of the value is in the immutability of non-malicious contracts (malicious with respect to the network itself, as is the case with an attacker that actively takes steps to hurt Ethereum). This fork may be revealing just how large that percentage was.",t3_4pd63n,commonreallynow
"This ""unstoppable"" quality you mention isn't why I signed up. I signed up, if you want to put it that way, because I believe in the technology and its ability to help the world through streamlining existing processes, add transparency which could help limit corruption, while also creating new markets we might not even be aware of yet. I admired how Ethereum was striving and continually pushing the envelope on what blockchain was capable of doing. What I didn't sign up for, is supporting outright theft when we have the ability, and in my mind, moral responsibility to make it right. I know the whole slippery slope argument and it's been discussed to death, so I won't go into that again. Ethereum has the potential to be so much, but having our image tarnished by this specific instance, something black and white in my mind, is just disappointing. One option is catastrophic to Ethereum, and it isn't the hard fork. Additionally, the people who invested in the DAO are far from weak handed imo, especially those who invested heavily. Return on investment from companies the DAO would have invested in was in the many months to years timeframe. So many of these would be long term holders whose coins will just return back to ""cold storage"" or to invest in other aspects that support and grow the Ethereum ecosystem.",t3_4pd63n,dpiatek
"This is a crucial argument.  It gets down to the core of the disagreement. One of the crucial decisions being made here is whether absolute immutability is a desirable thing.   /u/nullc  and the Core developers believe in that, obviously, but their approach isn't working.  Bitcoin is not only failing because the Core has led it down the wrong path; it is also failing because people have declined to adopt it. I think that one of the reasons why people have not adopted bitcoin is because of this ""anything goes"" ideal that many users and developers hold.  Banks have even said that they are adopting ""private blockchains"" because they want to see some sort of basic protection. Ethereum users should look at the big picture and be questioning exactly what is wrong with bitcoin.  One of the things wrong with bitcoin is that the Core developers are dishonest and untrustworthy, which Ethereum has already addressed.  But another is that some of bitcoin's key features and principles are not what the market desires. The latest versions of the Bitcoin Core haven't even been adopted by a majority of users because they are adding features that users don't need or want rather than fixing the one issue that users need to be fixed. Ethereum miners should look at the big picture and question ""what do people actually want and what will spur adoption?""  Sometimes, that means changing fundamental assumptions, as is being considered with reverting thefts.",t3_4pd63n,ProHashing

There is clearly a semi-large or at least very vocal subset of people (hardcore libertarians with a crypto anarchist mindset as far as I can tell) that believe the market is some sort of moral/educational tool. Like in order for markets to function properly, people must be ""taught a lesson"" and that's like a moral imperative I guess? They want us to be punished for our perceived weakness and failure and they view monetary loss of DAO holders as half schadenfreude half punishment. There doesn't seem to be any separation in their minds between poor investment choices (as in, allocating money in a way that fails) and a contract not behaving as expected leading to losses. Weirdly a number of them seem to couple this with absolute demands that we cannot attach morals to the cold unfeeling hand of crypto or markets, even while demanding that we learn a lesson through loss of money in order to discourage us in the future. I'm not sure what behavior they want to discourage exactly because speculation and building the crypto ecosystem through investment seems like the exact sort of thing free market libertarians would want to encourage. It seems because they decided not to participate, they view us not losing anything as punishment for them because they want to feel superior perhaps. In my eyes these concepts must stem from Randian objectivism, werein the weak must be punished for the weakness in order for the strong to flourish, so if society or community decides NOT to punish the weak (in this case DAO token holders) for failing to find a bug that a ""smarter stronger individual"" exploited, we are rewarding weakness and punishing strength. To those of us without those types of ideas spinning around our heads the idea of rewarding a thief seems like pure madness, but if you view the theft as the strong outwitting the weak, and you view that as a moral good, it makes more sense (I mean, it makes ZERO sense to me, but their understanding of the situation makes more sense.)",t3_4pd63n,fullmatches

"Why would you say that? Firstly, Solidity isn't the only language that can produce EVM bytecode. Use a different language or create a whole new one if you prefer. And secondly, Solidity doesn't have a  bug  per se, it just doesn't hold your hand when writing code to perform certain operations which makes it easy for a sloppy programmer to make certain types of mistake. Just don't make the mistake that TheDAO's coders made and the code will work fine. If you're depending on the programming language holding sloppy programmers' hands when writing a 100 million dollar contract you're doing it wrong. Pay for  good  programmers. And then pay for more good programmers to exhaustively check their work.",t3_4ot3z8,FaceDeer
"You really can't play off the lack of support from a language as ""well just do it well."" It's technically true, but history does not support that really working. There are similar low level languages (mostly thinking C) that have been around for a very, very long time. People still consistently make mistakes in those languages, despite having a lot more experience with what common errors are, and the usual sorts of situations that they occur in. You want all of it. You want a language that makes it hard to make mistakes. You want a language (and testing) that helps find errors. And you want good people writing the code, and good people checking the code.",t3_4ot3z8,ergtdfgf
"You have to make tradeoffs in language design between protecting against programmer sloppiness, providing flexibility to programmers who know what they're doing, and allowing for code to be highly optimized. Running code on the Ethereum virtual machine is  fearsomely  expensive compared to a traditional VM. Being able to produce highly optimal code is vital. And the amount of code that goes into a smart contract is very tiny. I don't think it's at all unreasonable to suggest that you should spend plenty of resources on hiring excellent programmers and performing tons of testing. Sure, you can create a language for Ethereum that's got garbage collection and safety checking and all manner of training wheels and idiot-proofing built into it. But no serious contract is going to use it when they could shave off that extraneous bytecode by using something more C-like. I'd recommend looking into adding compiler warnings and better static analysis tools for Solidity. That's the sort of thing where added complexity and safety can help programmers avoid errors without adding any complexity to the bytecode that comes out of the end.",t3_4ot3z8,FaceDeer
"Why would you say that? Because Solidity doesn't have static validation or types in the way that, say, Coq or Haskell do. it just doesn't hold your hand You'd think a language that will be computing millions and millions of dollars in value would  hold your hand  for the purpose of protecting those millions, right? Say, with types, or evaluation, or mathematical proofs, and messages telling you how you'd fuck up, or how concurrency is bad. But Solidity doesn't. So... I stand by what I wrote. Ask  https://twitter.com/maradydd  if you require more information on the matter. If you're depending on the programming language holding sloppy programmers' hands when writing a 100 million dollar contract you're doing it wrong. Sounds like the The DAO people did it wrong then, lollerskates. kek <---- this one kek kek (but they were afforded a shit language to begin with, so it's not entirely their fault...)

I'm currently in discussions with the Ethereum and DAO Devs about possibly mounting a different kind of white hat attack to secure the rest of the DAO's funds. The new white hat attack isn't vulnerable to random yes voters like a copy of the attacker's would be. Hopefully a decision on whether or not to move forward with it is reached before another copycat attack claims the rest of the DAO's funds.,t3_4ot3z8,cintix
"It raises weird legal issues if they do the attack themselves. If they ever plan on pressing legal action against the attacker, a valid defense by the attacker could be ""why does the foundation have the permission to do this attack, but I don't? Who sets the precedent of who gets permission? What was the formal voting procedure for this decision?""",t3_4ot3z8,thesilentwitness
"I understand why people are having difficulties believing this is possible: (from the site) A Curator is a failsafe mechanism that indirectly prevents malicous actors from executing 51% attack. [...] they are nominated by the DAO Token Holders themselves, and can be fired at any time, for any reason. Curators curate the whitelist, the list of Contractors authorized to receive ether from the DAO. A Curator therefore holds two primary functions: First, when a DAO Token Holder submits a Proposal in the form of a smart contract, the Curator checks that the published Contract on the Ethereum blockchain matches the source code the Contractor claims to have deployed (this is done by comparing bytecode). Second, a Curator confirms that a Proposal comes from an identified person or organization. This is done by asking the entity submitting the Proposal to send a signed transaction with a certain set of data only known to the Curator and the author of the Proposal, thereby confirming the author of the Proposal. The above are the only two functions of a Curator. For clarity, the following tasks are therefore not the role of a Curator, but instead the role of the DAO as a whole: Evaluate whether a Proposal is ‘good’ or not. Audit the Proposal’s smart contract code. Provide legal advice regarding the Proposal (if any). Take responsibility for the Proposal.",t3_4jmaop,Jaxx_Chris
"thus, the first paragraph is worded incorrectly. as Gavin stated, they are not a ""failsafe"" in any centralization sense. instead, this ""failsafe"" is there to check for malicious actors saying that EVM code is the same as a github solidity, when it is actually not. similarly, they check for malicious actors saying that they are a valid contractor when they are not that individual. they  do not  prevent against a 51% by themselves, by blocking splits. any 51% attack of a proposal voting on a new curator, invokes the potential for a split. thus, these curators can be voted out entirely in favor of a new curator. as is specified on the website. In the attack I mentioned, the split would be the 49%. The takeover would be for the 51%, which is 51% of the ETH holdings of the DAO (which is fine) plus ability to change the DAO contract code and access the extraBalance (which is not).",t3_4jmaop,Jaxx_Chris
"Just reviewed what you said properly and double checked with the specifications. I never like to be wrong (who does) but I fear you are actually correct. It may be impractical at this stage with this dao but it's certainly viable. Moreover, it can be done with little at risk for future dao's using this implementation. I'm with Chris, it needs addressing for the future definitely - i.e. don't complicate things unnecessarily. An attack can steal funds. That includes someone buying up shares gradually on the market. So this attack is viable even with this dao going forwards. Whether it's worth it or not is a different story and some economic modelling may be needed. Withdrawing significant funds early may increase the dao token price the larger the additional funding pot is. I'm less concerned by this since those funds go into projects and I'm hesitant to predict the dao will be profitable overall.",t3_4jmaop,newretro
"There are additional factors at play. New curators necessarily are in the split, by definition. So the remaining party cannot change curators. I've not verified the implementation here but did check the specification in the whitepaper. Curators sign off on code changes. I have verified the implementation although not run tests. This begs the question, could curators be compelled to sign off on transfers?",t3_4jmaop,newretro
"Here is what the Curators do.... The Contractor has to write their Smart contract and deploy it to the blockchain FIRST and then they say, ""Hey Curators, I want to submit a proposal to the DAO, here is the solidity code for my smart contract, the address and here's my proof that I am a good guy"" The Curators do 3 things: Check out the Contractor's code and make sure that the bytecode on the blockchain matches the solidity code they sent to the Curators (a quick script). Check that the code does what it looks like it is going to do and isn't a potential risk to break the DAO if it is voted in. (5-15 minutes of checking for these guys). Check to make sure the guy isn't the CEO of Mintpal and has some legitimate background. (They are not going to scam the DAO). If those three things check out, then the Curators add their Smart Contract Proposal to the Whitelist (not the Contractor's address) and the Contractor will have to have some DAO token but then they can submit the proposal to the DAO for it to be voted on. The Curators in no way pass judgement on whether or not the Proposal is good or bad, only if it is valid and not an attack.",t3_4jmaop,GrifffGreeen
"Are you sure that they do #2 and #3?  My understanding of #2 (check the code to see what it does) is that this is something they specifically do NOT perform.  For #3 (ID verification) my understanding is that the person submitting the contract is at the address for payment, but that they do NOT validate anything related to the character or motive of the individual / company.",t3_4jmaop,mphilip
"/u/mphilip  You are right on 3, I overstated what their role is designed to do. They are just there to confirm the identity of the people. If the CEO of Mintpal (Known scammer) makes a proposal and the code checks out and is not malicious, then he will be identified and his Proposal smart contract will be added to the whitelist.

"This is what I am trying to figure out. The white paper says that the single Curator will have considerable power, essentially able to unilaterally determine whether an address can be added.  To protect against abuse, users can elect a new Curator. TheDAO site says that the Curators (vs a single one in the white paper) only validate that the address belongs to the person who submitted the proposal. It would be nice for one of the Curators to actually weigh in on this.  My reading of Gavin's resignation from begin a Curator leads me to believe that it ain't the safe protector-of-the-universe role that the white paper and many people here is suggesting.

"In theory yes... but in reality, how would someone get hold of 60% of DAO. If you did attempt to achieve this, you would at the very least drive the price of DAO upwards substantially. Then presuming, you did manage this feat, you perform your attack and you get hold of your additional 5m ether. However as the DAO is now so large to be considered of systematic importance to ethereum, the demonstrated failure will collapse the price of ether. So you will be left with additional 5million near worthless tokens. Yaaaay! Buy high, sell low - not a very smart attack! That said, it should be fixed, even if its not very likely to be used, it could be used by people who have something to gain from Ethereum or the DAO failing.",t3_4jmaop,dnydublin12
"I'm not sure it would be collapse anything at all, it would effectively be a corporate hostile takeover. This happens all the time in other industries (and will absolutely happen between DAO's at some point). Whether a hostile takeover results in liquidating the assets or reappropriating under-utilized resources, these are both legitimate usages. Right now, there is an argument to be made that the extraBalance is completely under-utilized. If it reaches 7 million (which is not unlikely at the 1.5 multiplier in the final days), unless the slock.it team asks for and is approved for a 35 million budget (20% is 7 million), it will not be utilized, potentially for months.",t3_4jmaop,Jaxx_Chris
"I have to disagree, I think it would collapse today, simply because of the relative sizes of the entities concerned and the publicity it has received. The ratio of the amount of ether in the dao vs the amount of ether in the whole ecosystem is quite high coupled with the fact theDAO is the first killer app ethereum has had. In normal hostile takeovers that we see in the business world, those businesses are not as big relative to the national treasury or the economy as a whole and there are plenty of other things going on in the world.

""Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production"" Modern western socialism is fully compatible with large facets of the capitalist structure. ""By contrast, market socialism retains the use of monetary prices, factor markets, and, in some cases, the profit motive with respect to the operation of socially-owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them.

"The precedent for thefts then becomes: ""if you attack this network and steal people's money, you will have taken a large risk and won't earn anything for your trouble."" This is a very advantageous promise for a network to make. First, it significantly reduces the motivation for hackers to attack in the first place. Suppose that an attacker has 1000 hours to devote to either cracking the next DAO, or trying to find a vulnerability that obtains Satoshi's private key. He knows that even if he cracks the new DAO, miners are likely to band together and make him come out with nothing. So he will instead attack the bitcoin network, where he can keep his gains (or not perform an attack at all).

"It's fine to consider the future, and what might happen, but that's not how you're asking your questions. You're asking for static measures of acceptability and morality. I'm not describing a cop out; I'm describing the reason that your questions are structurally unsound. That's all. If our morals are in flux as people enter and exit the system, isn't that a good reason to avoid making moral judgements on transactions? Otherwise, how can someone be sure that a smart contract will be faithfully executed?",t3_4pd63n,kd0ocr
It's not an argument. It's the reality on every blockchain. No one knows the value or condition until a patch is put out and it's either installed or ignored. Right now it looks like the fork to restore the DAO's funds has broad support.,t3_4pd63n,eze111
Again I'm not arguing at what level a fork should or shouldn't happen. Just saying that a decentralized blockchain can and  should  reverse a transaction if it has broad support.

"I'd say the miners are setting the rules and precedent based on how they predict speculators will react.  Iff  speculators aren't worried about moral hazards, then the short term incentive is to support the soft fork and reject the hard fork. I think this is an actual slippery slope. First the guys who oppose any seizure leave, and it's easier to get a majority supporting the next seizure, and so on.",t3_4pd63n,Explodicle
"Miners have the  final  vote on the rules and consequently the ledger derived from those rules by choosing which patch to install or ignore. But it's the community who proposes, debates and uploads those patches. Also miners aren't gonna waste hashpower mining a chain or coin that the community doesn't use or support. So it's a broad consensus if a fork succeeds. I agree about the slippery slope but the issues, technology and circumstances in the future when the next incident occurs will be different and will be have to be debated on it's own merits.",t3_4pd63n,eze111
"Fair enough, I can get behind that description of who sets the rules. The point I was trying to make is that precedent is the only reason to care about long-term ramifications and not just accept every seizure fork that isn't one's own funds. The next fork will be debated on its own merits, but only among people who are OK with seizing funds obtained from enormous heists. Everyone who is against all seized funds for any reason will be gone, so it will be easier to get a minimal 51% Nakamoto consensus on the next group of wallets to seize. I don't know if you follow bitcoin closely, but Core's scaling plan is subject to the same feedback - Bitcoin slips down the slope where everyone left must be OK with more and more off-chain scaling. It's gotten to the point where it's unclear if bitcoin will ever have any more on-chain scaling ever again. IMHO the bottom of a slope where we're all using LN/sidechains 99% of the time is still useful, but a slope where one whale burns his last opponent's Ether and ""wins"" PoS is not.",t3_4pd63n,Explodicle
"Seems like Core is married to SegWit for scaling and like you said those who disagree have left or allocated more time for other projects. And unfortunately we'll also loose some people here with the forks. But remember Ethereum is younger and much more aggressive with on chain features than BTC. The EVM, Casper, sharding are all very new or just being written. Bugs and mistakes will be inevitable. That's why hard forking the ledger is more palatable over here and in the long term I think will turn out to be the right decision.",t3_4pd63n,eze111
"We already agree that blockchains are prone to slippery slopes, and have two examples (off-chain scaling, on-chain features) of it happening in practice. So why  won't  this slope end with lots of seized wallets? Every round the seizure will sound less reasonable to an outside observer, but still be acceptable to the 51% who remain. I haven't heard any explanation for what exactly will limit this feedback loop.",t3_4pd63n,Explodicle
"Less reasonable for blockchain purists but not for the mainstream which is what Ethereum is counting on. Different goals and mindset from Bitcoin. In my opinion this actually opens up a niche for an Ethereum clone or EVM playform whose developers or community guarantee immutability. Maybe it exists already - RSK, Expanse, Counterparty? Of course ""guarantee"" has many interpretations and can possibly be bent or broken.",t3_4pd63n,eze111

"At some point, you're creating a new currency. If the hardfork changed the ownership of 100% of ETH, it would be an entirely different currency.

I don't subscribe to the bitcoin ideal that all transactions should be immutable, even when people steal money.

After all, nobody disagrees that money was stolen here, and nobody is confused about who was responsible or what happened.

No, the possible fork being discussed strictly affects no transactions of ETH. No joke, there are no ETH transactions involved in the fork. No rollback.

Ethereum is a complex beast and works differently to Bitcoin. In this particular case, a hard fork would replace what would normally be an immutable contract. It doesn’t involve transaction rollbacks (well…) or rolling back the actual chain. When people think of rollbacks, they think the entire chain is being reverted back to a previous point.

Also, take a second to think about the devs who have dedicated the last year of their lives trying to make Ethereum better, purely because of that original vision - they now risk having all that work thrown away because of a vocal minority. Hard-forking is a selfish move by bad investors, and against everything Ethereum was originally sold as.

"Sorry I didn't understand what you are proposing. How would you fund this new DAO? Create ethereum out of thin air via a hard fork? That would be a 51% attack/modification on ETH, not the DAO. As is, the DAO will not have any money by the time people have the power to vote on moving the DAO's money (except by employing a similar hack). Also, the contract cannot be updated from within itself to stop this. There is an update provision for the contract but it's not strong enough to stop the attack. So you can't use majority control of DAO tokens to save DAO funds in any way. The entire design was spectacularly bad this way.",t3_4ot3z8,ctrader7088

Simple as that, as a temporary immediate fix today. If not, than what the hell is a 51% Attack on a DAO? I started a new thread on this proposal and it seems to be gaining momentum. You might know some technical details about TheDAO smart contract that prevents a 51% Attack and could explain it here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4othu5/can_we_51_attack_thedao_now_today_right_now_period/",t3_4ot3z8,Cyberider007
"It has to do with the DAO creation schedule. 51% spend ""attacks"" on the DAO cannot be done now because my understanding is this is a split-only phase of DAO creation. The DAO cannot spend any eth yet, only transfer to child DAOs, which can also not spend eth yet. Unless they use the exploit themselves the few children who are splitting around now would only get what they were supposed to get, leaving the rest to be hacked away. Simply put the DAO token holders cannot spend the ETH now due to a delay in the spending ability which is coded into the DAO contract. The plus sides of these delays are that the hacker cannot spend his ETH right away either.",t3_4ot3z8,ctrader7088

"For those who didn't follow the link: I wouldn't call myself part of the Robin Hood Group, not because I’m afraid of legal consequences or ashamed of it, but because I don’t think I’m worthy of that title. The guys who made the DAO counter attack were able to create attack vectors much more sophisticated than the original attacker developed, and created new ways to twist it so that the original attacker couldn’t counterattack. They set up active running scripts that at some point were constantly draining the dao to 1 wei, to capture any ether the attacker sent to the DAO to set up a new attack. I would never be able to do any of this. While I did a small part in helping the original counterattack, I’ve also been told that since the first attack most of the original group splintered and only a few kept pushing forward. I haven’t participated since that day, I don’t control any of the private keys to any relevant addresses, I had recent contact with them, but since the main goal was accomplish I don’t intend to keep contact and I certainly don’t want to be seen as their spokeperson for the next step.. Also, even the small part I did, I acted as an individual, not as part of the Ethereum Foundation. I never told Vitalik about my plans and when Ming, the Executive Director, asked me about it I refused to tell her, so that the Foundation wouldn’t be in any way implicated or active in this. Last time I spoke to the White Hat Group about the status they had told me the attacker was able to run off with a big part of the funds and while they had recently won some battles, the funds were far from secure as they were still aware of possible attacks – which is why I didn’t want to make any public comment on that matter, otherwise the attention could jeopardize this whole thing. AFAIK part of the reason they were more successful now was because the DAO had less value and was under a lot less scrutiny since the fork. Before you guys talk about what they are going to do with the funds, notice that this group had absolutely no obligation to keep doing what they were doing, yet kept doing it anyway. They worked hard for the fork to happen because they wanted all the DAO investors to be made whole – and they accomplished that – but then the Ethereum Classic community made its central tenet that such a solution was morally wrong and we were all corrupt for doing it. The blackhat hacker tried their best to ruin any chance of counterattack, negotiation or ceasefire) yet I’ve seen posts in this community comparing them to Satoshi Nakamoto. These guys have done what no one else was willing or capable to do, yet they are constantly harassed and whenever I read a question about the White Hat Group’s ETC funds, the first answers usually mention lawsuits or assume malice on their part. I wonder how many DAO token holders today are even the same people who believed the original vision and participated on the launch and how many tokens are currently held simply by people who wanted to buy them for a chance of an arbitrage opportunity. I don’t blame those guys for asking themselves why bother do so much for people who seem to hate them so much. Now, of course, this doesn’t represent the full community, I’ve been in contact with people from the Classic mod team that are trying to change the tone, but my recent experience having to defend small API choices on the wallet as mr Gravity automatically assumes the worst about it, made me realize this isn’t the charitable and understanding Ethereum community I met at Devcon0 and 1. To make it completely clear, while I appreciate the irony that the same people who claimed the Dark attacker was the rightful owner because “code is law” are asking the opposite of the white hat attackers,  I don’t endorse this idea : my understanding has always been that they would do their best to give the money back to the community, otherwise they would be no better than the black hat. I do not know what they intend to do now  and I learned that the recovery was successful via the multiple reddit mentions. While I believe they have the best intentions they are also at risk for a lot of legal troubles and costs. On a personal note I’ve lended them DAO tokens for the attack, which I haven’t seen since. I’ll be asking them for the eth-dao to be returned, but I’m donating the etc-dao to them. My main point is this, they could have washed their hands of all this the day of the fork and let it all be taken by the thieves you applauded. If anything is ever recovered it’s all due to the tireless work of these people. So instead of constantly debating how much the white hats owe you, ask yourself how much you owe the white hats.",t3_4wpsch,avsa

A good portion will likely not be able to withdraw it, as they wouldn't even know how to sync with the ETC network and do the appropriate transactions. So that same group would again be looking to make money off people's ignorance. They need to set up a smart contract, as Christoph did on ETH, where original DAO holder on ETC get back the 60 or so % proportional to their DAO holdings and that's it. That would be a fair settlement, and as I said, I have 0 conflict of interest as the only asset I have are ETH.",t3_4wpsch,DaedalusInfinito

If Lefteris and co. cash out, they were the ones behind the DAO code that failed, and I'm certain a few of those DAO holders whose ETC they cash out will start getting in contact with some darknet communities, so I highly discourage them from going this route...

So just to summarize: The Foundation pushed everyone to invest in the DAO even though it wasn't code ready. Then everyone lost a ton of money (the Foundation lost the most) The Foundation pushes for a transaction reversal so they get all their money back. RBG (which has ties to the Foundation through  u/avsa ) started a counterattack to retrieve stolen funds.

AFAIK part of the reason they were more successful now was because the DAO had less value and was under a lot less scrutiny since the fork. Interesting that they would tell you this, given they had in their possession at the time a means of preventing the attacker from splitting his darkDAO--they just chose not to take it.  It's the same method they used to ensure successful extraction of the 38k-ish ETH someone ""accidentally"" sent to the DAO after the fork. In fact, as near as I could tell (from the half-functional block explorers and my own scripting), they never even made an attempt to block the attacker's exit from his child DAO. To be honest, I don't trust them with any of this.  They act like children, make false promises, and generally are asshats when you accidentally maybe kind of reveal their plans, and then when called out on it, get super bitter and angry.

Still, your proposal is a drastic change to the protocol, as you are essentially proposing a way to override the code. Not just once, but potentially for every contract. I don't expect it to be better received than ""the"" hard fork.

"Hello, I believe I have an option that requires only soft forking to recover the stolen funds reliably, without hacker response being viable. An upgradeable proxy contract controlled by the DAO, such as the solidity code below, is deployed to the blockchain: contract proxy { address agent; address owner; mapping (bytes4 => uint) sizes; function proxy() { owner = 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413; } modifier onlyowner() { if(msg.sender==owner) _ } function setAgent(address _agent) onlyowner { agent = _agent; } function setResponseSize(bytes4 sig, uint size) onlyowner { sizes[sig] = size; } function() { bytes4 sig; assembly { sig := calldataload(0) } var len = sizes[sig]; var target = agent; assembly { // return _dest.delegatecall(msg.data) calldatacopy(0x0, 0x0, calldatasize) delegatecall(sub(gas, 10000), target, 0x0, calldatasize, 0, len) return(0, len) } } } This is based on the model referenced in  https://redd.it/4kt1zp  , however makes some compromises to upgradeability to ensure that the upgrade process cannot brick the contract. 2. One or more individuals with a vested interest buy some tokens in the dark DAO, and donate them to this contract. 3. The current soft fork censorship rule is changed to the following: The existing rule, that calls shall not be permitted that result in a reduction in the balance of a DAO account, shall be amended to exclude any transaction in which the account above is the first contract invoked, allowing it to withdraw funds. As this contract's implementation may only be altered by the (slow) voting process of the DAO, miners will have an opportunity to respond to any abuse of this power. They can, and should, insist that any attack code is coded in a way that may not attack legitimate splits. As these rules require only censorship, not a change to the network state, only a soft fork is required. 4. As the contract above is upgradeable, it may be updated to include attack code, which initiates a split from the dark DAO, and uses the recursive call attack to create a further child DAO with all the funds. 5. As the curator of the child DAO, the DAO-controlled proxy may transfer funds to an agreed contract to refund ether. The best thing about this is that the DAO stakeholders can take their time to debate and vote on the exact way to go about recovering their funds, using the governance structure as it was intended to be used.

Secondly, that isn't how contracts work, in court contracts often get large amounts of judicial interpretation to achieve ""fair ends"". You can sign away your kidneys in a contract and if someone takes you to court in any civilized country they'll get laughed out. Thirdly, c'mon don't tell me you bought that pastebin stuff without checking the bogus sig? Lastly, theft if a criminal offense with plenty of legal precedent.

A theft is a theft if it can be proven so and in this case it is likely that in a majority of common law jurisdictions, it will be considered theft. If we find his identity he's screwed.

It isn't only in the states that common law applies though varying bit by bit here n there. Also if you were to listen to the video throughout, you would have picked up that they specifically mentioned that doesn't mean that a contract states something means it can not be changed or altered. The judge has the power to alter the terms of a contract when they see it necessary and fit. They might not be able to change the code, but they can hold you accountable for not adhering to the terms set by them. Also the main point is that he exploited the code to gain financial advantage. The code was never intended to be exploited that way without the knowledge of the other DAO token holders. The claim of the attacker that he used the code as it was supposedly used is definitely arguable in court and should the jury find him guilty of exploit, justice will be served. This is quoting the lawyers in the video on their knowledge and mention regarding the attacker's responsibility of loyalty to the business stuff. This in my opinion of him doing something that is unknown to fellow business partners causing them losses while he gains financial advantage, is a form of deception and if I'm not mistaken there are provisions to jail someone and is a criminal offence for someone to obtain financial advantage by deception.

Remember  the proposal to increase proposal fees to 11 ETH? The hero can passes these at will. Using his majority vote, the hero will pass self modifying proposals to prevent any further theft Example: voting periods to split will change to 1000 weeks. Or event better, allowing the  hero only to split and use the exploit After a few proposals, we hopefully have a safe darkDAO except we can't get the funds out because of the soft freeze.

"I was purposefully trying to be vague.. but since the upvotes suggest people want specifics-- I am referring to the spam attacks on the Ethereum network, and the quick solution via parity. I am definitely not pointing any fingers, but it is suspicious to say the least. To add, the spam attacks weren't designed to destroy Ethereum, as people have mentioned, different attacks happened at different times, seems like the attacker was trying to give the Ethereum team a chance to form solutions, kind of like giving people vaccines - giving small amounts or dead versions of the contagions to allow the body to create antibodies. So this leads me to think the attacker likes Ethereum, he may just not like certain parts of it. That is why I'm interested to know why Gavin left- again if there was a falling out- was there someone he didn't like, etc. I could go deeper into some other observations I have made... but I think this is sufficient enough for now to at seek to understand what exactly happened and why Gavin left. edit: Not sure why this so unpopular, don't you guys want to know who did the spam attacks too? I don't agree with this method of forcing change on the Ethereum network. Same as with the DAO attack. There are far more benevolent ways of doing it, and I don't know if you guys realize but there are probably less than 100 people in the world talented and knowledgeable enough in the Ethereum realm to do either the DAO attack or the numerous spam attacks.

"Very much this. It is almost surprising that people who build on a technology that was born out of skepticism towards inflationary monetary politics believe that doubling the network is a viable direction. However, this situation overall also illustrates the misconception that collective representation is the sum of individual opinions, certainly not a problem exclusive to the realms of blockchains. Forming majorities is a process that has to open up to different opinions at some point to ensure being just, but it also has to become indifferent to deviation at other times to become able to act.",t3_4ugjoh,VoDoka
"The network isn't being doubled, though. It's being split. There are now two competing currencies with identical functionality. I certainly agree that having two is bad.

"There has been some argument over the relevance of this to the main ETH community, and whether it ought not rather be left exclusively to the breakoff ETC/Ethereum Classic community. My take: it is relevant to our ETH community, for at least these three reasons. A large number of people, who held about 12 percent of all Ether as of May 2016, had invested in The DAO.  Their funds were taken in the mid-June hack, and The DAO was sunset as to it's original objective, and went away as an entity that could fund projects in the Ethereum space. They will care about the residual value of their DAO stakes that yet remains on the ETC chain. The broader world, and the media that occasionally cover nascent blockchain technology, will necessarily conflate Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in many ways.  This community (ETH) should be aware, and ready to intelligently respond when warranted. The technology currently used by the ETC community is either the same (e.g., Parity v1.3.9) or direct ports (e.g., Geth v1.4.18 has been ported to be Geth v3.0.0 on the ETC chain, and MyEtherWallet.com was ported by Elaine Ou to be ClassicEtherWallet on the ETC chain).  The ETC devs have implemented (yesterday) the exact same OpCodePricing hard fork that the ETH community implemented a week ago.  They may separate further some day, but for now, it is what it is. My point: we are still yet intertwined, at least for now.  Therefore, the movement of ~ US$4 million of value by the hacker is of interest to all of us.  The OP has done (another) good service to the community by studying up and summarizing it for us.",t3_59g2pb,Prefect7

There may be other examples of subtle yet significant differences My point: we are still yet intertwined Agreed. Still yet. When ETH goes PoS (Casper) and ETC remains on PoW (which is highly likely), and before that when ETC diffuses the bomb in a few months, then the Ethereum twins shall diverge.

On the ETH side, if he did as I thought he might (amassed DAO tokens), he now has a bag of ETH on that side to do whatever he wants with.

Like everybody else, I found a problem in the code that pays out to approved proposals. Luckily there were no approved proposals, so this vulnerability was useless. This is what Slock was talking about when they said no funds were at risk. Since proposer contracts would be reviewed by curators before whitelisting, they could watch for the attack and simply not whitelist nefarious proposals; all you'd have to do is look at the proposal's fallback function. The thief attacked a completely different part of the code. I missed it entirely because I ctrl-f'd for ""call.value"" instead of just for "".value"", which would have at least raised the alarm about the split function. It was also a more subtle attack, involving an interaction between two functions instead of a simple attack on one. However, though it was easy to miss, I don't think this makes the attacker the smartest Solidity programmer. If he'd figured the attack out for himself instead of after it was published by someone else, I'd be more impressed.",t3_4ugjoh,ItsAConspiracy

"Insightful. That would actually be the best possible outcome for everyone, both pro and anti-fork. I hereby encourage the attacker to do just that.",t3_4ugjoh,TaleRecursion

"Well, we suspect that he made a fair amount of cash shorting ETH right before his attack became known. And he also could have made a huge amount of money buying DAO tokens predicting the HF. So there's reason to think he has a fair amount of money available to trade with.",t3_4ugjoh,darawk
"Well written article, but not well thought out. In the scenario, DAO token holders (that haven't already lost their ETC address) would be entitled to a refund on both chains. It comes down to long term value. If you received a refund from a thief on one chain, and a Robin Hood on another chain, what would you do? You would say, ""dumb move thief"" and trade your ETC in for ETH as soon as you received it. Most people already did this once. If the DAO thief does this, he could possibly make money, because there would be a temporary rise in ETC and a temporary fall in ETH, but the thief's next best move is to sell all his ETC. These two things leave ETC at zero in the long term. Remember, short term buying and selling behavior have little to do with the long term prospect; they are just a volatility byproduct of a young new technology. In the long term, developers and users will live on a chain with the brain trust of people that are transparent about their intentions. So far, I haven't seen to many prominent supporters of ETC showing their faces. In fact, most of the ETC supporters are campaigning on blogs with new accounts to conceal their identities.

In fact the split in the community has cost ETH holders more than the DAO hack would have. If I recall, the current value diverted to ETC is currently double that of the DAO hack had the hacker got  all  the funds. And I believe that wasn't even possible because of various whitehat hackers taking more funds to pay back the DAO holders. So the hacker at most would have got away with $25mm of ETH whilst the Ethereum market cap has lost over $100mm to ETC. I could argue that the fork cost every ETH holder about 10% of their stash. And what for? To pay back  innocent  investors? The Foundation made it sound like this was grandma investing in the DAO, those poor innocents!

There was no force involved except by the community as a whole.

(It is also important for the ETC community to apply this upgrade as well otherwise they may be DoS'd as well and if they do that goes a long way towards proving the upgrade is not contentious. i.e. the Catholics and Protestants both agree)",t3_56cxnb,Dunning_Krugerrands

"upgrades can have improvement that affect the network now, other upgrades are to protect or improve the network in the future, and we are about to make changes to gas costs to protect and improve the network now AND in the future it is still an upgrade as the move to POS in the future would have left the security of the network in the hands of an unknown attacker due to their control over large amounts of ETH, implying it is just a refund is missing the entire reason for the fork",t3_56cxnb,DaSpawn
This is a myth of the DAO hack that simply refuses to die. The hacker would  not  have had enough Ether to seriously compromise PoS. Any system of PoS that could be compromised by someone holding a mere 5% or even 10% of the Ether would have been fundamentally flawed and never deployed in the first place. Vlad Zamfir posted about that shortly after the hack happened.,t3_56cxnb,FaceDeer
"can you show me where you get these numbers from?  When the entire DAO was eventually drained how many ETH would have been held by a malicious actor? how is holding a large amount of the ETH in the POS network that has a known malicious actor not effect the network if they will certainly be moving/manipulating transactions even if they controlled 5%?  It will certainly cause disruptions on the network I honestly want to see where these numbers come from and if there is more research regarding this, dismissing it as a myth sounds more like trying to dismiss a very large potential problem that changes the reasoning behind decisions in the DAO situation",t3_56cxnb,DaSpawn

"Here's Vlad's original post on the matter . He's the main dev working on Casper so he's pretty much the authority on how PoS will behave and he had no concern over this. The hacker got 3.6 million Ether out of TheDAO . The total amount of Ether is currently 84,764,118 according to  https://coinmarketcap.com/ . So it was actually closer to 4% of the Ether supply than 5%. The hacker could have theoretically got about three times that much, TheDAO had about 10.9 million in it [ 1 ],  but the original hacker deliberately stopped draining partway and the ""white hat group"" stole the rest using similar exploits.",t3_56cxnb,FaceDeer
"as a whole there was a security exploit leaving 3.6 million ether to be used by whoever/however in the future, and it did not only need to be POS related, whatever group did the attack. Vlad being comfortable with it did not mean it would not be an unforeseen problem that was easily avoided by forking and upgrading the security of the network in the future",t3_56cxnb,DaSpawn
"I think you've misunderstood something. The security exploit was in TheDAO, not in Ethereum. Once TheDAO's Ether was drained out of it there was no more Ether stored in a vulnerable contract. The 3.6 million Ether would have been securely held by the hacker, not by ""whoever"". The 3.6 million was not vulnerable any more once the hacker got it. Also, Vlad was quite explicit about what he was comfortable with. He said: I'm comfortable with an attacker owning a very large portion of the ether supply, in Casper/PoS, because the attacker will lose a lot of money from causing failure modes, and the community will be able to recover from the failure modes. He wasn't talking about being comfortable with it because Ethereum could hard fork and steal the Ether back. He was comfortable because it didn't matter if a malicious actor had the Ether in the first place, Casper is going to be robust against attack by holders of that size.",t3_56cxnb,FaceDeer

"Ah I see. However, except for  maybe  the 21% attack, these all meatspace problems. I'm looking for a term here. They're 2nd order, or Level 2 (Level 0 is Ethereum, Level 1 is the Dao which runs on Level 0). These attacks (except for 21%) are all de facto supported by Dao, but they are not caused by the Dao. I think that's an important distinction.",t3_4ox2co,samplist
"Right, but The DAO is trying to convince people that they are solving Level 2 problems with Level 0. When they didn't solve anything.",t3_4ox2co,carloscarlson
"Some Level 2 problems are solvable in Level 0 and 1, while others are not. I don't think anyone believed that all Level 2 problems were solved. If they did then they're flat out naive. The smart contract does what the smart contract does. It is deterministic.",t3_4ox2co,samplist
"Except for maybe a system of Stake based Voting, what Level 2 problems were solved?",t3_4ox2co,carloscarlson
"Exactly that. What was supposed to be solved was the impossibility of releasing funds outside of the voting. It is this impossibility (aka immutability), that is now being  threatened by fork. Which is why I believe a fork is crazy. It threatens a fundamental value proposition of blockchains.",t3_4ox2co,samplist
"I'm with you on forking. I just sold almost all of my Ether to get off this sinking ship. But I don't think that Stake based Voting is necessarily all that valuable. It certainly isn't that decentralized, and isn't really all that different from POW. I think we are seeing right now that the 'wisdom of the crowds' is nonsense.",t3_4ox2co,carloscarlson
"Also, to get to the original point. It is more economically beneficial to try to steal as much Ether from token holders as quickly as possible, than it is to operate under good faith.

"While of course you may find a lawyer to try to sue over almost anything, the common law is abundantly clear that the attacker would face far greater risks over being put in jail than chance of refund of his stolen ETH.  The fine print of contracts does not protect when the spirit of the contract is grossly violated. Imagine if Apple added a small statement in the iPhone contract that said if you purchase one, you owe apple a million dollars - do you really think that would be enforceable in court? Not to mention that hard forks are an inherent possibility of using any public blockchain and there is no one party responsible for their implementation.",t3_4r6xgk,latetot
"Why are you assuming just the attacker?  Also, an attack can be ""successful"" even on the basis of a legal theory that has a counter-argument. So arguing that lawsuit risk is low because you can think of a defence may be tempting, but dangerous. Think patent trolls waving their bogus patent at some part of the google App Store and getting millions... It is dangerous to wave litigation away on the basis of merit alone.  It's not about what you can prove. It's also about what it costs along the way.  Most litigation settles. But there's gas cost. Yes, it costs an attacker to litigate, but if you think your target is a 150M$ enterprise that is demonstrating disregard for real-world laws, you might be able to find someone willing to finance the cost... Particularly if there's a billion dollars worth of shortable, fungible, anonymous assets that might be affected in the process. You could even use a strategy that wins even if it doesn't win. These aren't logical attacks. They are financial attacks. And the people who perpetrate them are professionals. This is all of course my opinion and not legal advice.  I am not a lawyer. To comment on your substance, i think you are right about the consequences of violating a contract. i also think frustration of a contract by a third party is also actionable. But this doesn't only apply to the one attacker.  Replacing theDAO code is, without a doubt, changing the fundamental contract (even if code isn't law, and even if the contract is more than the code).  As a result, if we think in terms of  ""attack surface"" a few things spring to mind. You and i seem to agree: interference, by anyone, is actionable. So then we probably agree the hard fork, as proposed, is actionable, because it replaces, and in fact frustrates an essential part of the bargain. So that means we probably agree that the folks who participatei in that fork, miners and devs and exchanges, etc, go from being bystanders in a 150M$ exposure, to active participants in a 1B$ exposure, because in order for the fork to succeed, they must choose to participate, and act. But who can bring an action? Attacker, yes, again we agree... Anyone who participates in fork could be actionable by the attacker.  Can he sell his rights to a shell corporation? Possibly... maybe a suit is without merit... but at that point, you have to pay to play... Anyone else? Hmmm... Standing is not limited to the attacker. Depending on the theory of damages (remember, if attacking, one can be creative) standing could potentially be purchased on the open market by buying DAO tokens, or worse, by eth.  There are enough ""trolls"" on this thread who are opposed to the fork, on all sorts of theories. Could there be one who wants to get rich as lead plaintiff in a class action?  what if there's another bug?  So not only do we have an extrordinarily large and open-ended attack surface, but it can be analyzed and attacked in the context of as-yet -unknown actions and events... In comparison, analyzing the DAO code is a cake walk. Anyone who thinks it wasn't done perfectly might wonder what their exposure is to an even less inspected set of eventualities. The second thing i think that happens with a fundamental change to theDAO code, if done by parties to the agreement, is that it results in a fundamental breach of the legal agreement that bound the initial formers of theDAO.  Some of the agreement is in that ""code is law"" part. some is elsewhere. I looked here:  https://daohub.org/explainer.html  and read beyond the disclaimer part that everyone has been arguing. I Read All of it. All the way to the bottom. Those pages and pages were probably not put there because someone had a lot of extra capital letters they needed to burn.  When the fork happens, I suspect all those terms are unenforceable, and offer no protection to anyone anymore.  And if so, that opens the entire attack surface these words were designed to address. Someone paid good money to be advised to put those words there.  Why did they go to that trouble? What happens if they throw that advice away? Yep, like the soft fork, I am becoming more worried that fixing the problem could open up a very dangerous set of attacks.  Not just from our attacker, but from others, who may be lying in wait, or even actually damaged, now or after the fork, and are opposed to the fork, or who aren't made entirely whole. Litigation potential was previously confined to a few people.  I think the initial poster is right:  it might be more than a good idea for people to go get some very good, INDEPENDANT legal advice.  If i was operating a commercial enterprise with assets, one that cannot remain anonymous, I would be very cautious with respect to the hard fork, because these are where I suspect an attacker might go.

"I tend to agree with you as well by the way, just so it's clear.  I also have first-hand experience with an ""arguable"" lawsuit, and it wasted a lot of my time and money. Didn't matter whether or not I was right.  So I don't look at the legal system as ""I'm right, therefore I will win, therefore no worries"" The law is code.  It behaves according to rules that are complex, time consuming and expensive. We should not be naive and think that there is a short, straight path to truth. Particularly when millions of dollars lie along the path. Also, unlike code, the law is not perfectly interpreted by a brainless unemotional CPU. I have seen judges ""not get it"" and make a mistake (my opinion) in ruling on procedural matters.  You think it should go one way, you have all the logic in place, but one adverb has more meaning to the judge than it does to you, and poof, there goes your whole line of impeccable logic.  I've seen evidence ruled inadmissible due to certain technicalities, and seen other technicalities waived... It cuts both ways, and is unpredictable. Having sat across the table from an adversary, whose strategy was not to ""arrive at THE truth"" as much as it was to ""explain one or more plausible truths"" (again, my opinion), I now have a profound respect for litigators.  And, I do admit, a little bit of anxiety, which colors my perspective. Yes.  Go after the hacker for his damages. But do it legally, with the protection of the law.  If we undertake vigilante justice, there are likely to be consequences.  Our police and justices have statutory protections and can't be sued for intervening to make things right.  Ethereum and its participants do not. So I would be very reluctant to insert myself in what is already shaping up to be a legal furball... [edit: missing word]",t3_4r6xgk,jps_
"""...it seems to me to be entirely feasible that ""The Hacker"" might then turn around and sue..."" True, there is a risk that the hacker will sue the interveners as a result of intervention adverse to the hacker, and that the theory there would be that the hacker is entitled to the ether based on the ""bargain"" he struck by entering the DAO contract. However, you are ignoring all the other potential lawsuits at risk (each of which, like the hacker's potential suit against the interveners, would require proving one or more legal theories that are currently unproved, but, like the hacker's theory, not entirely implausible): -->the non-hacker DAO token holders might sue the potential interveners (especially slock.it) for negligence, fraud, etc. -->the non-hacker DAO token holders might sue the hacker on the theory that the DAO is a partnership as a matter of law and the hacker breached his fiduciary duties to his fellow partners by draining their ether, entering into a conflict-of-interest transaction by way of a short on ether, etc. -->the SEC might sue the potential interveners (especially slock.it) for unregistered sale/issuance of securities -->the DAO token holders (including, potentially, the hacker) might sue slock.it for rescission due to the sale of DAO tokens constituting an unregistered sale/issuance of securities -->the SEC might sue the hacker for securities fraud -->other governmental agencies might pursue charges of theft, cybercrime, etc., against the hacker While the risk of creating legal liability (to the hacker, and maybe others) through intervention is real, is that risk any greater than the risk of doing nothing, considering that a failure to ""fix"" the putative ""problem"" would increase the risk of all of the other lawsuits I mention above?  I don't think so. On the contrary, I think that, even if you just look at things from the perspective of the potential interveners trying to limit their liability, ""fixing"" the ""problem"" is probably the least of all evils in this case.",t3_4r6xgk,le_wraith

If soft fork happens then the funds are locked until another possible soft fork or hard fork is passed. The soft fork is to stop anyone from withdrawing these ether. This will give everyone more time to find a solution. To be fair Vitalik is talking about bailing The DAO out with The DAO's own funds.

Because the fundamental architecture of the system allows such an eventuality  the value that ethereum has in that regard will be  exactly the same  with or without a fork.

Maybe try and shut down known nodes based in those countries if they aren't conforming. But I agree that the outcome of the situation is irrelevant. If the fork doesn't happen, it was still a possibility that could have occurred. Could still be a possibility in the future too. Fundamentally cryptocurrency is only worth what people value it at.

"This is becoming much more interesting than Game of Thrones. As TV show it’d be a hit: “A Run to Get the Virtual Cash”. Here we are, new gyrations on the race to grab as much as possible of the $150M pile of cash. In this episode, we see how the curators, the very same figure that was used as strong marketing tool to give investors confidence, is now disposed in a very nice coup d’état (so nicely French). Once curators started to realize that assuming legal responsibilities in exchange for some vanity reinforcement was not a great deal, the problems started. One curator left, others opened their eyes: wait a minute, what is really going on? I put my name and my reputation and others get the cash? Am I getting into a big mess for nothing? Well, yes my dear curator, you have been played. The feeling of manipulation is not pleasant and some curators react by saying: no way. What do they do? They point to some of the obvious design deficiencies and say publicly that the whole thing is a bit messy. I can imagine very interesting discussions behind the scenes. Now, what would you do if you find a rock in your way to get a good chunk of the $150M? Yes! You get rid of the rock!. Facing the curators protests, you start by downplaying any concern: “well, those risks may have some merit, but they are…. a bit exaggerated”. Then, you question the motivations: “this curator is not really committed”, or even more strongly: this professor is “pathetic”. Next step, you dilute the dissidents votes by including new friendly curators: we have new curators to the team!. Finally, just in case, you design a new proposal that bypasses the curators altogether: the coup d’état. Who cares if they were “safeguards” of the token holders. Now they are… I don’t know, they are something else that needs to be eradicated. Ladies and gentleman, the show must go on. I have to admit that it has become addictive.

But because it was not intended to be used as soloSplit, it is more complicated than it needs to be:  https://github.com/slockit/DAO/wiki/How-to-split-the-DAO The StalkerAttack, which was identified as an issue when doing a soloSplit can be fought against:  https://github.com/slockit/DAO/wiki/Why-The-Stalker-attack-is-a-non-issue In my opinion the Stalker is in a much weaker position than the victim. It should be called ""attack the stalker"". Unfortunately this hassle can not be addressed in the proposal framework, but only with an update of the contract.

Anything less will cause some investors to feel betrayed or mislead, which I don't feel is in the DAO's best interest.

I think in time, the issue could resolve itself through education and contracts that automate the splitting process, but will those solutions be ready for the non-technical investor before the first vote to distribute funds?  I hope so. As an aside, I will likely keep my ether in the DAO.  It is specifically the difficulty of withdrawing my ether which causes me to question whether I should.

"You are flat wrong. I believe that you don't know how Nakamoto consensus works. You really should start by reading the Bitcoin whitepaper. I'm not being snarky. Ethereum wouldn't exist without bitcoin. Let me try to explain: The client, such as geth, implements the protocol. The protocol actually changes in order to support the soft fork freezing the thieves funds. In Version 1 of the protocol, any address can send to any other address. In Version 2 of the Protocol, funds cannot be transfered from a specific address. In other words, an address is singled out and frozen. Version  2 means nothing if a majority of miners don't use it. This is what us meant by ""Nakamoto Consensus"". The network is emergent from and is defined by the miners, and nodes to a slightly lesser extent. Ethereum is whatever the miners and non mining nodes say it is.",t3_4oxq4v,samplist
"The eventual plan is to issue a refund of a transaction recorded on the blockchain. I don't care how you spin it semantically, that is deciding between two versions of history. And it is  hilarious  having someone here tell me to read the Bitcoin White Paper.",t3_4oxq4v,Twisted_word
"We actually agree. I'm strongly against the fork. However, the protocol defines what is historical. It implements the history. The protocol needs to be changed to rewrite history. You understand that the protocol is implemented by the client, and that the client AND the protocol must change to initiate a fork, right? This is axiomatic. That's why I refer to the bitcoin  whitepaper, which is the first place this action was described. There have been calls to update the Ethereum Yellow Paper with the Dao fork for this very reason.",t3_4oxq4v,samplist
"Again...the idea that you condescendingly feel the need to explain how consensus works is hilarious. This process of soft fork then hard fork, is  choosing between two versions of history, one where the ""rightful"" owners were relieved of their coins, and one where they are not . Whether this is accomplish through a roll back or not, it is choosing between two versions of history.",t3_4oxq4v,Twisted_word
"I don't disagree with anything that you're saying. What I'm trying to get you to understand is that the history, as you put it, is intrinsically tied to the protocol itself. You can't change history without modifying the protocol. You're latching onto the word history as if its some technical word. In the normal protocol, all accounts can transact with all other accounts. In the updated version of the protocol (the one that rewrites history), there are new clauses that are added that a) revert transactions that already happened, or b) stop certain transactions that would normally be possible from happening, under very specific circumstances (such as having to do with specific accounts). I don't disagree that history is being rewritten, and that this goes against the ethos of immutability. We're on the same page. The changes that need to be made to the Ethereum client are changes to the consensus code - they are protocol level changes. The specification of the Ethereum protocol changes with this or any fork. Like I said, this is axiomatic. It's not open to debate. I have nothing more to say.",t3_4oxq4v,samplist
"So what you are say is, in addition to choosing between two versions of history, people are also it seems screaming for the recklessly stupid move of destroying fungibility too?",t3_4oxq4v,Twisted_word
"Absolutely. The soft fork, as proposed, would block any ETH to be transferred out of the attackers account. It would freeze their account. A software fork has been proposed, (with NO ROLLBACK; no transactions or blocks will be “reversed”) which will make any transactions that make any calls/callcodes/delegatecalls that reduce the balance of an account with code hash 0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba (ie. the DAO and children) lead to the transaction (not just the call, the transaction) being invalid, starting from block 1760000 (precise block number subject to change up until the point the code is released), preventing the ether from being withdrawn by the attacker past the 27-day window.  source The attackers ETH is not the same as all the other ETH.

The reason the fork is even being discussed is that now there is a large risk of different kinds of attacks by the exploiter because of the large sum they took. These attacks would affect the value of Ether as well as undermine the integrity the public chain itself. Calls for a fork would be ignored by the miners if we were using a currency with the market cap of 100 billion which isn't that large really. The market cap of Ether is going to be a huge vulnerability for ethereum for the foreseeable future. Miners can be coerced by adversaries that hold large % of the ether pool and their only defense will be ally with each other to censor the potential attacker like they are doing with the exploiter.",t3_4oxq4v,[deleted]

"Exchanges can't refrain from at least processing withdrawals in both coins, or they'd be at risk of being sued for stealing assets with potential value. Because of this they will probably just leave trading open on both chains until it's absolutely certain that the price of one of them has gone totally to zero. A big question is if they are allowed to switch over the order book on ""their own"" to their preferred protocol change, before there is absolute certainty that the price of the old blockchain has gone to zero. I'm guessing no, because they would also be at legal risk and could only protect themselves if they make switching the existing order to the new order book a manual process. The reason why these kind of scenarios don't happen with a ""regular"" hard fork that upgrades the protocol in some material way is because it literally has consensus, as in not a single person gives a damn about the old blockchain because everyone benefits equally (though i bet if you really want to troll you can use the same ""process withdrawals in coins from the old fork"" strategy to at least annoy exchanges in regulated environments during protocol upgrades). I think exchanges should start thinking about, and publishing, specific terms for what happens during contentious hard forks.",t3_4qr794,Rune4444

"Hello there, As one of the people who worked on the refactor of the contract which now forms the back-end of EthPyramid, I thought my input might be helpful here. In the aftermath of the collapses of the two previous iterations (I won't name them, they're everywhere), a handful of us made a genuine attempt to repair the underlying flaws in the contract to see if it could be made viable. This involved throwing out a lot of ERC20 functionality such as transfers and tossing in some safe math operations where necessary (which is wasteful on gas, but a cost I think people are happy to bear). Why did we do it? I can only speak for myself, but I work as a software engineer in the financial industry, and hold a PhD in a field where invariant assurances can be formally verified in systems-critical operations. A bit of an academic exercise for me. I contributed my own Ether rather than standing on the sidelines as I had foolishly talked some colleagues into putting some Ether into one of the failed previous iterations, and chose this way to pay them back. I've also claimed multiple times that any profit made other than my own initial buy-in will go to charity. I haven't got an interest in making a side profit from this. In terms of why we maintain the front-end still (and this may be my Jesus complex talking), we're trying to provide an honest guardianship of an  immensely  stupid idea. There will always be people who throw Ether into stupid places in the hopes it's the next get-rich-scheme. We've been totally transparent about the mathematics involved, open sourced our GitHub repo, point directly to the smart contract, and generally go to a lot of effort to be around and answer questions (hence this reply). [Brief edit: our own smart contract can be found here:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fa0ac498d01632f959d3c18e38f4390b005e200  - any and all documentation is mine, so if you have questions, please ask away. I've also gone into a  lot  of detail in my previous comments on this account.] This may be naive, but I like to imagine that if people run an honest system (as terrible a financial decision as it may be for some due to the zero-sum nature of pyramid schemes), it sucks SOME of the air out of the Bitconnects and DavorCoins where a  lot  of handwaving exist(s/ed). In retrospect, we wish we'd never released our variant onto Mainnet, but as soon as we try to take the front-end down, a clone pops up with a MITM attack on the MetaMask target address.

The open address one is just ridiculous though. Why does creating a struct (even if I’m storage) overwrite other data in storage. Shouldn’t the struct just be appended to the end of the contracts current storage (seeing as the storage boils down to a map it’s not like they ran out of addresses)?  And the link you gave that goes to the solidity guide (which I’ve read up and done countless times) doesn’t say much about this vulnerability. In my contract work I try to stay away from structs due to how ambiguous the docs are and so I would love to hear from you since you seem to get it more than I do. Also, the only place I use structs currently is within maps with the struct as the data, or as data within an array I push to. I assume those are safe or is there some security concern I should take into account?",t3_7xvoui,Chugwig
"It's detailed in the Reference Types section. You're not creating a local struct in the example above, but instead creating an implicit storage pointer.  SeedComponent storage s;  is equivalent to  SeedComponent s; . If you wanted a local copy that didn't affect storage you would do  SeedComponent memory s; . Each member of the struct acts as an offset ie. pointer + offsetOf(member) = storageLocation, where offsetOf is dependent on the size of the member variable.

"It doesn’t clear up much but it helps a bit. I already knew it wasn’t local, the docs are pretty specific about that and how you should declare storage or memory if you need to be explicit. Comparing this to C or C++, we’re simply creating a pointer to the struct (storing the pointer in memory and the struct in storage).  But when I create a pointer to a struct I never have to worry about the pointer being one already in use unless I’ve previously freed it (or my heap is broken). So while I understand almost everything about what solidity is doing here, what I don’t get is why you’re saying that the memory for the struct is the same memory as the contract state variables. Shouldn’t it be it’s own memory, even if it is in the same part of memory as the contract state variables.",t3_7xvoui,Chugwig
"Comparing this to C or C++, we’re simply creating a pointer to the struct (storing the pointer in memory and the struct in storage). Let's not think of it as a struct anymore and just say generic storage pointer. Then the first member of a struct points to data (starting from index 0) corresponding to the size of the datatype. In other words, if the first member of my struct is a uint256, then I'm pointing to the entirety of index 0 of storage (remember storage slots are 32 bytes). If the first member of my struct was a uint8 then I'm pointing to the rightmost byte of index 0. Let's say I have two members in my struct, the first a uint256 and the second a uint128. The first member points to index 0, and the second member points to rightmost 16 bytes of index 1 in storage. You have to stop thinking of this in terms of C++. Solidity functions differently. Does this clear things up? Edit: As an exercise, try thinking of how you could create a programming language that would write that struct to a new slot in storage. Just to get things going, you might reserve index 0 as a ""slot counter"".",t3_7xvoui,brenjerman
!FUCK 10 Thanks for giving a fuck about my questions! Your exercise is the exact reason I asked you this question in the first place.  Is Solidity not a language where we can expect a struct declared anywhere in our code to be offset correctly in the memory of the program and of what use is being able to declare structs that are just unions of the contract. And if Solidity isn't a language like that then wow.  I'll owe you a few more fucks in exchange for the new project.  I know there are other languages besides Solidity but I'm a big fan of the modifiers and what they bring to the contracts.,t3_7xvoui,Chugwig

If you can take your time to answer me these two questions that would mean a lot :D p.price = uint96(_paid);
require(p.price == _paid);
 Is that the best way to check that casting doesn't ""fail"" because of overflow? Is it any different than doing require(_paid <= 2 ** 96)
 ? I see that send is frowned upon, but in this case I wan't to make sure that old_owner can not keep ownership of the item forever by reverting when receiving funds so I thought send was the way to go instead of transfer. Does that makes sense? old_owner.send(_paid * 98 / 100);
",t3_7xvoui,akhanubis
"Either way works fine. The second example has a logic error though since  MAX_UINT_96 = 2 ** 96 - 1 , otherwise that should work. I think your use case for  send  is fine. You may want to add in logic to handle a  send  failure (though it's probably not necessary).",t3_7xvoui,brenjerman

"I read the website, faq, watched videos and still don't understand. What's so hard with explaining directly what it is instead of using vague analogies for 20 minutes? When you create an application, where does the code and the DB sits? If this is to replace the internet, you're talking about taking the entire internet, all the existing commercial DB in the world and transferring them to peoples PCs BitTorrent style? Where both the db and the computational tasks be distributed?

"Kind of. It's nice to see a critical opinion on the subreddit. Let me start by saying that most people on the subreddit tend to focus on the technology, and the use cases can be hiding in plain sight well above it.

So if i want to watch youtube, i'm connecting to who knows what 2k people to load the website, another 2k for every video i want to watch, and another 2k when i run a youtube search? Bitcoin revolutionized digital cash by being totally decentralized. Money was in the hands of the holder instead of in the hands of ""trusted"" parties like banks and brokers. Ethereum revolutionizes digital computation by doing the same thing. When you watch a YouTube video you are the product. Google collects information about you, your history, your name, your interests, and sells you. The modern web has evolved to support this model. Ethereum flips the value proposition. A YouTube on Ethereum would have the user pay for their bandwidth piecewise over swarm and the raiden network. When they do a search they pay for a small amount of computation for pattern matching on the golem network. Normal people can buy hardware that lets them easily contribute to the decentralized net, and when their device is used as a node in the network they are paid a small amount that likely lets them browse the web for a net 0 cost. Users keep their information private though projects like uPort. A bank could interact with the network and provide cryptographically provable attestations of wealth or loans. Users don't even have to keep track of a private key. Your phone can generate one, you can connect with friends, and then any three friends can change your ""account"" to recover your funds. Trustable fundraising can happen with 0 margins. Bitcoin put the power of money back into the owners hands with powerful cryptography. Ethereum just does the same with computation. But smart contracts make money management cooler too.",t3_61y5ix,ScientasterSteve

"1st. You seem to be confusing a bunch of things here. Ethereum is a bit difficult to wrap your head around as it is.

Or just doing a couple minutes of googling ( https://dapps.ethercasts.com ). Or you can check out some of the sites of individual products like Golem, Augur, or BAT. 3rd, you're on the subreddit that is ethereum-related that probably understands ethereum the least. Many people on here are simply interested in it as a money-making venture/investment. Which is OK. But a large majority of them do not truly understand the capabilities of ethereum.

"It's hard to believe that anyone could have known that the DAO attack would lead to a hardfork which would lead to Ethereum Classic refusing to go along. I see evidence of isolated opportunists but I don't see any evidence of coordination. It seems to be, a case of cascading failures where at each stage the community doubled down on it's risk rather than accept failure. As a result the current loss of market cap to ETH since the DAO event has been in the neighborhood of $500 Million USD. That's something like 5x the amount of value in the DAO contract (please correct me if I'm wrong here)? Likewise I don't think it's as many bitcoiner's being recruited into ETC as people here consistently assert. Most that I've talked to are just Ethereum people who are ideologically opposed to intervention, and a lot like me, have been involved from the beginning though we are not insiders. It also makes sense that those people would have the type of hashing power needed to support ETC. I still have the same 8 GPU rig I built to mine the olympic test net. In my case, I'm as much practically opposed as ideologically,  I think there is a hidden cost to intervening  into the state of the database and I'm not interested in paying that cost or participating in the administration of interventions. At the same time I recognize that the majority of developers have a vested interest in the ETH chain and in seeing it grow and it's likely to remain much larger and technologically ahead of ETC for the foreseeable future. One outcome has been to reveal an existing rift between more Keyesian and Austrian schools of economic thought in the community, and it's possible that those could not have coexisted for long regardless of the timeline of events.

The complexity of the DAO's design and it's built in delays created the chaos of technologists poring over what  was possible in response with a clock-driven frenzy.  As some have mentioned, there was a huge ""bug bounty"", which has a remarkable way of focusing eyeballs.  It seems to me from this point in time that a number of opportunistic and idealistic actors have been motivated to jump in and try things.

These are petty skirmishes in the new Great Game for our decentralized future.  I advise looking at these events more as crude PoC's for the challenges to come.

I hope that you see how suggestions like this provide examples of everything that is wrong with the idea of a hard fork to redistribute ether and/or issue new ether in rules different from the blockchain's published rules. For one, it shows that the ethereum developer and mining community are able and willing to develop and run software that seizes ether from one private address and puts it in another.  That destroys the entire notion of security at all in ethereum: ""Your ether is your ether unless we hard fork away your ether or soft fork away your right to spend your ether"".  In the future, someone will say ""X address has too much wealth, time to redistribute, and both the code and the precedent are set.  Bribe the miners to accept the new hard fork that seizes ether from some address with some of that ether and it will go through.""

"Technically the extra balance does not belong to the late investors.  The tokens of the late investors represent exactly the same share of the DAO ETH balance as those of the earlier investors. That being said, an HF should  definitely not  be used to do anything other than undo the theft. Certainly the discussion around an HF is complex, but we must consider that Ethereum is an emergent system of contracts and establishing validity and integrity of contracts is of paramount importance. This fact calls two competing axioms between which we must find a balance: Contracts should not be externally overwritten. Errors in contracts should not be allowed to legitimize theft. Both of these principles are required to maintain integrity and validity of the Ethereum system of contracts, just as both uphold the value of all other successful contractual systems with which we are familiar. In the system of ""dumb"" contracts with which we are most familiar this balance is expressed in contract law and maintained by the system of courts via a community based decision on the validity of the contract in question. In our system of ""smart"" contracts the contracts are validated by code at the base technical level, but computers are not yet able to judge the validity at the higher ethical level. That is a task reserved for humans at that is the task that lies before us now.  In some respect we are fortunate to have this opportunity to make a validity judgement with such a clear and significant example of theft via contractual error in which it is actually feasible to disallow the theft. I believe that we should continue to follow the decentralized principles at the heart of this and other cryptos in the process of fulfilling this task and subject the judgement to the PoW consensus mechanism of miner/node vote on code. And in that vote I would urge the miners/nodes to follow the wisdom of traditional contractual systems and disallow the legitimization of theft by the manipulation of errors in contract, and do so by returning the ETH balance to a contract which can be used to either continue the DAO (doubtful) or withdraw as per the decision of the individual token holders. In doing so the community would firmly establish the principle that the Ethereum contract system is not an avenue for legitimized theft and allow us to get busy finding a better decentralized solution for potential future situations in which human judgement on the validity and integrity of smart contracts is called for.   Perhaps the DAO token holders would consider using the extra balance to fund just such an endeavor.",t3_4os7l5,SeemedGood

"Even if this isn't considered again, the knowledge of its possibility is a warning to all future DAOs and investors to do your due diligence and maybe invest a tad bit less in each venture.

"This isn't a question of bailing out an investor loss.  There is no money being redistributed from one legitimate owner to another. This is theft via contractual error and the question becomes whether or not we want to build a contracts platform that legitimizes theft via contract error. In the traditional contracts system, contracts which are discovered to have a unilateral mechanical mistake which allows one party to the contract to ""snatch-up"" consideration to the detriment of other parties in the contract (which is what happened in this instance) the contract is considered invalid so as not to allow theft by contractual error. Having standards which judge the validity of a contract to prevent such theft is what makes a contract system valid in the eyes of the public. If theft via contractual error is legitimized by a contractual system, it would be difficult for the broader public to see that as a just and valid system of contracts and Ethereum would have a tough time making headway in adoption.",t3_4os7l5,SeemedGood

Now, a security flaw shows up in this HTTP alternative - the biggest website to use it, lost 50 million dollars, lets say. Now the proponents of this obscure, seemingly shittier, HTTP decide to undermine ""buzzword 1"" and ""buzzword 2"", in order to get that 50 million dollars back. So on what planet would company X adopt this new HTTP? It's slower, more complicated, almost nobody on the planet can use it at the moment, it has a widely publicised 50m dollar exploit,  AND  it no longer shows any real commitment to buzzwords one or two.

Either miners adopt the fork (and get punished if they don't), or another team of devs maintains a non-forked fork (heh) of the codebase. So, realistically it's the devs (specifically the maintainers of geth) who get to decide. I'm not saying EF directly, but if the 'big players' reach a consensus to only maintain code that includes the HF, the miners have no alternative unless another faction of devs works on maintaining the unforked chain.

"If we start going down this path, why have a blockchain at all? But it's a fact that no blockchain is ""immutable"" - they are at best ""almost immutable"" if their mining is well-decentralized. Blockchains only guarantee that their data has consensus.  Reaching consensus on changes is extremely hard but not entirely impossible, by design.  There are legitimate cases in which consensus can and will be reached to invalidate blocks and transactions that might otherwise appear valid, if they are unenforceable by the network (ie. ""suicide pill"" contracts or transactions will never be validated because they ask the system to do something it is designed to prevent - namely, to harm the value of the coin being mined).

"Btw if DAO token holders are not made whole the value of you ETH is prob around $0. In my opinion you have that exactly backward.  If DAO holders are made whole then the value of ETH is dimished due to the  moral hazard  created by artificially rewarding market failures while punishing investors who chose wisely and avoided the bad risk. The DAO was a 100% failure to secure funds.  Its value  should be  at or near zero, provided the attack is expected to complete. ETH value is best supported by miners locking and burning the attacker's coins, in my opinion.  This demonstrates that no weaponized or poisonous contract will be considered valid by the network - an important demonstration in a Turing-complete system that will probably one day see its own ""worms"" and ""viruses"".  Were it not for the ability to shut down toxic contracts that harm the network at large Ethereum would surely one day burn down.

Meanwhile, all non-DAO investors have to shoulder the financial burden of the failure to perform sufficient due diligence - which there was - in the form of lower prices for ETH, which we are also seeing today on the markets. This is for a coin that - without intervention - should be priced at  zero.   This is strong evidence of the action of  moral hazard  as markets predict a reimbursement. This is not only unfair to investors who  wisely  stayed away from the DAO, but it also sets the dangerous precedent that buggy contracts will simply be ""CTRL-Z""ed away by a fork, which creates  moral hazard : it increases the likelihood that this happens again, further damaging ETH holders at the expense of the  next  DAO meltdown/bailout. I'm not being hyperbolic - if the DAO or its investors are made whole, it will make me think very seriously about divesting my Ether.

So all I can come up with are scenarios where they're deeply philosophically conflicted about what they're handling, or they did try pulling a fast one and are now either backpedalling or trying to think of some other way to pull a fast one.

"Speculation, but here is what probably happened: The exchanges failed to protect their DAO-classic tokens the same way that they did with ETC. Its a complex situation that has never been seen before and was rushed upon them. Also, if there was one token that is arguably worthless on classic, its the DAO tokens themselves (reason we forked in the first place). Because of this, they cannot simply make another ""refund contract"" in classic similar to the one in eth. For that to work, the exchanges would have to release all of their dao-classic tokens corresponding to dao holders at the time of the fork. Those tokens are probably drained.  Luckily  those tokens do not actually hold value themselves (the whitehats have control of the salvaged value), so they simply need to distribute what they have in proportion to dao holders at time of the fork. who has this info? The exchanges would have internal records of this. So they will simply take the ETC and fairly divvy it out based on those records. Those few people who had DAO tokens outside of an exchange will have to get theirs somehow, maybe through more traditional legal means of proving claims. Again, all speculation, but it would explain why they have to work with exchanges instead of simply making it available through a refund contract.",t3_4xasg3,voltzroad

"To be honest, I feel you on that. It is kind of depressing. But that's also the thing I like about the crypto space. It's an opportunity to build systems that are robust against bad actors, because you start of on the assumption that everyone can be a bad actor. Not that they are, but that they have the potential to be. It's supposed to help you design a system that self-reinforces good behavior... Not by punishing bad behavior, but by making it unprofitable. In other words, it's supposed to pay more to play by the rules. Of course, all of the above is part of the reason I was against the fork. It undermines a lot of those assumptions and systems by falling back to the most subjective one: human judgement.",t3_4xasg3,DeviateFish_

"Erm non sequitur? The world is not black and white and cryptos are not about utterly removing humans from everything. They're about picking trust points. Maybe as an older dev I have a different view but trusting software to run without human intervention has failed time and again. Smart contracts are useful but they don't need to do away with humans (at least until proven mathemetically or through rep). We also have humans writing and delivering the interface layer. Smart contracts provide for transparency and interoperability, also reducing the need for trust between parties. But even that is over time because smart contracts need to be upgradable - at least you have transparency tho.",t3_4xasg3,newretro

Humans manage your internet connection. Humans write the cryptography software than other developers trust (without audits may I add). Etc. Humans are fallible and, depending where you are, you see differing levels of issues or even corruption. The best thing about blockchains is they can provide a level of transparency. However, humans are often required to make decisions and these may not be clearcut. In many cases it's just not possible to set logical rules. So yes, it is about who to trust. You're trusting developers who are trusting other developers. Your dad will trust you or some tv show or app store for what software to use. Trust is everywhere. The world can't operate without trust. Humans can't operate without trust. The reality is that 99.9% of the world are trusting humans the entire way, even if it's trusting slacknation to say that this smart contract works as expected. They're not trusting code, they're trusting you. And if there is a problem, they'll call you. Or the developer :)",t3_4xasg3,newretro

"That's one way to read between the lines.  But I read this whole situation another way. The white-hats' identities are known by too many people for them to safely walk away with the money--Jordi is a known guy and is identifying himself as being in control.  So, if they are going to profit from this, they must do so in a way that maintains a proper appearance.  The guys doing this are smart enough to know that an exchange will notice and react when they suddenly drop 3 million ETC on them the day after they 7 million were retrieved from the DAO.  Accordingly, they wouldn't move the funds to the exchanges without prior assurance that the exchanges will cooperate (which assurance they probably have).  But the plan is not to liquidate on the exchanges and run.  The plan, rather, is to profit by manipulating the markets before returning the funds.  By first coming forth and announcing good intentions, they achieved high impact for a dump (ETC) and pump (ETH) when they make it obvious that funds have moved to the exchanges.  Now, by announcing a buy back, they achieve the opposite effect.  Of course, they traded both sides of this (along with the exchange operators).  They probably were able to achieve such great impact with very little actual trading (low risk of losing funds).  Now (or after further shenanigans) they will return the funds to the DAO holders and the only charges they think they could face would be related to market manipulation and those are unlikely.  They and the exchanges walk away with good profit and they get to remain ""white-hats.""",t3_4xasg3,Lejitz

"Oh dear. Sorry koeppelmann, but this is very short-sighted: What are the arguments for and against the soft fork? The biggest argument for the soft fork is the prevention of the huge mess that would occur without one. There are philosophical arguments against it - essentially the softfork would be a form of censorship. However - most affected by this censorship would highly welcome it (all DAO token holder) expect the attacker. However - there is a small group of people also affected by this who not might want it - everyone who spitted in a regular manner and is confident that no one of the other shareholder in this splitted DAO will atack them (e.g. because they are the only one). We have not even  begun  to fully understand all of the arguments for and against SFs/HFs. There are numerous  different  SF proposals on the table, each with a long string of caveats and downsides/upsides that 99% of the people here do not know or understand, just like they did not know or understand the caveats of The DAO. To characterize the situation as quoted above is grossly negligent. ""Huge mess""? Can you be any more vague? What about the ""huge mess"" if we do take one of these forks? Here are some  actual  reasons, that aren't ""philosophical"", against  any  HF/SF: ""I'm impressed how Ethereum managed to take a compromise of DAO into an opportunity do destroy all of ETH by killing fungibility/etc."" ""Ethereum adds --illegal-code-hashes option for miners to blacklist addresses https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2715 … & with that, I'm done with Ethereum"" ""Expect it? Have you reached consensus with the community? A lot oppose.. This is centralization."" And that is just a tiny sampling of what's out there and what we can expect to come. We cannot know what they all are unless we give  time  for  public  discussions and  consensus making . Rushing ahead with any decision right now would be a repeat of the rush to invest in the The DAO.",t3_4os7l5,itistoday
I hear fungible used often in a way that I believe is wrong. Please correct me if I am wrong (haha - not really necessary to ask with this crowd!).

It appears that it is being used incorrectly here.,t3_4os7l5,sc_jp
"You are correct, I was in the middle of writing a post on that and related topics. EDIT:  done . I want to make this  very clear  (and this is not a swipe at you or anyone, just a clarification): in listing those arguments I do not (and did not) express my endorsement of them, only to point out that they're not (1) entirely illegitimate, nor (2) ""philosophical"". The only point I was (and am) making is that  we need to give time to both hear and acknowledge the arguments.",t3_4os7l5,itistoday
"It would require a coordinated effort of the majority of the miners. Coordination is important otherwise a miner would likely lose his ETH. You should clarify this - a miner running a soft fork when nobody else is will not earn any ETH. They won't lose ETH they already have. It's likely that coordination would be accomplished by any soft fork patch containing a block number at which it would become active in any case. Miners need to communicate with each other and define a block in the future that should be used to switch over to the new version. As soon as the majority accepts a new version it is dangerous for a miner not to use the new version. Again, this sounds hyperbolic. An unpatched miner on a post-soft-fork chain may generate invalid blocks if they contain now-prohibited transactions, but at worst this decreases their earning power.",t3_4os7l5,nickjohnson
"This depends on how the soft fork code is implemented. If the code is implemented to completely ignore blocks that have tx that violate the soft fork rules, then the miner would keep trying to build on a shorter chain, even though their blocks would be accepted by everyone else. Alternatively, if they don't ignore all blocks that have tx that violate the soft fork rules, then it only takes a single miner still mining on the old rules to keep the soft fork from fully taking effect. The tx that are being censored would be delayed, but they would eventually get through when the one miner mined a block.",t3_4os7l5,mr_burdell
"I don't think anything you've said contradicts what I wrote, does it?",t3_4os7l5,nickjohnson
"well, depending how the software patch is written, from the miners perspective, they could lose eth if they're not seeing the longest chain.  They will believe they have eth, and when they realize they're on the shorter chain, they will ""lose"" it.",t3_4os7l5,mr_burdell
"I would add:  it is controversial to return coins to the DAO or its stakeholders  because if investors or the DAO are made fully or partially whole, the effect is a wealth-transfer from holders of ETH who did NOT invest and whose ETH will go DOWN as a result of making investors of the DAO whole (because there is likely to be future moral hazard), to the holders of DAO - which  failed  - whose DAO tokens will go UP (as a result of being reimbursed). This is completely against the economic best interest of every ETH miner and holder, and it creates the possible incentive for further failure to perform due diligence if investors believe that they will be bailed out whenever contract bugs are exploited. There is nevertheless a compelling reason to lock the attacker's coins, and that is that the attacker will hold a significant percentage of all ETH as a result of this exploit... and we are planning to move to POS. For that reason I continue to advocate (reservedly) for a soft-fork to freeze the coins, and a subsequent hardfork to burn them.  This is a hardfork that benefits every ETH holder, and punishes only the attacker, DAO investors and the DAO itself. This has nothing to do with the morality of ""theft."" The necessary action when faced with a contract exploit that threatens ETH holders / miners generally, or any otherwise weaponized contract, is that the affected coins are quarantined and burned and the contract is terminated. Edit: I must add that it is only my opinion that the attacker represents a threat to the network, but I'm willing to hear evidence and opinion to the contrary.  If the attacker isn't considered a threat, then it is absolutely my opinion that the attacker should keep the coins.  But this should be all put to direct miner vote where each option is possible. Also note that a softfork to quarantine the coins is a ""soft, easily undone"" measure, while hardforks will probably be permanent.  Conservatism says go fast with the softfork, and slow with the hardfork. TL;DR: let's vote to let the attacker keep them, or let's burn them, but let's not return them.",t3_4os7l5,tsontar

Market feels calm that exchanges has frozen the funds and no risk of massive dump anymore, so you long ETC while chinese guy pumps ETC to rise the price higher.

It's amazing to me how many scandals ETH devs/Foundation/slock.it can have without any consequences.  Surely they can't get away with this one?

"They have set it up to pretend as if anything that happens on the ETC chain doesn't matter, and doesn't have consequences. The hard fork was never really about saving their users' money.  It was entirely about protecting themselves from lawsuits due to negligence. This is why people saying that this Dev or this member had DAO tokens are missing the point. They were saving themselves from the legal class action that could've come (at the obvious expense of their entire network). Now the game is to pretend ETC doesn't exist for as long as they can. So, if it doesn't exist, then anything that happens on that chain doesn't matter (or so they want to pretend). The good news for them, is they seemed to play it pretty well. It's working. Anyone who would probably sue for negligence, got their ETH back. And they have mostly successfully convinced people that ETC is a scam or something.

"You know that it is literally altering a contract at the protocol level, as in it will have to be included in the yellow paper and other dumb shit. It's not so much a slippery slope as it is free fall into a spiky pit of death. The reason why a hard fork that alters the state of the blockchain to the benefit of a third party cannot succeed is because only the third party that stands to benefit is incentivized to use the new fork, whereas everyone else who doesn't benefit are incentivized to stay with the old fork. If it's possible for the third party to use off chain bullying to force everyone to switch then the blockchain should correctly be classified as a private blockchain rather than a public one (of course the real public Ethereum Blockchain will always remain regardless of how many special interest hard forks that happen, and this is exactly why a special interest hard fork simply cannot be done)",t3_4os7l5,Rune4444
"Telling your earliest adopters that their funds are gone and we refuse to recover them because it would require ""changes to the yellow the paper and other dumb shit"" does not sound like a way to attract users.

The users who want to do a fork-fix to recover their funds from the tampering by vulnerability exploit are not third parties! They are the users of the platform, and since hard forks are technically possible, coordinating a fork-fix is perfectly within the rules of the game, and they should not be discouraged by a vocal minority who believe that bugs should only be fixed if they don't require changes to the yellow paper.",t3_4os7l5,cdetrio
"It's exactly because no money gets lost, supply just shifts to those who didn't get their money get stolen, that burning stolen funds is such a good rule of thumb. DAO investors are a third party attempting to alter the Blockchain to their benefit. It doesn't matter if they hold ETH or are users of the system, the point is they are trying to gain additional money by forking the protocol.

Also, whatever happens, we have to ensure that the attacker doesn't get to dump $250 million worth of ETH on exchanges later.

We need to establish incentives for people who want to build on Ethereum, as The DAO was doing, and disincentives for people who want to undermine the ecosystem, as the hacker was doing.

We wrote a piece of code that allowed this to happen and we must be willing to face the consequences for it. The incentives are already there for people to use ethereum as a platform, but they honestly need to write better code. The first thing DAO should have done was hire auditors to check the code, and then insure itself somehow or hold the auditors liable.

If we want serious developers to develop Dapps and DAOs, and users to invest in them, then we need them to feel secure in doing so. There's no way out of this without compromising some principle. Many people hold the principles that innocents should not have their money stolen from them and that thievery should be discouraged just as dearly as you hold the principle that no one should be in charge of anything. To me, the guiding values here should be what is most likely to lead to a healthy ecosystem of functioning Dapps and DAOs. If bribing the thief gets us there, then so be it.

"He who holds the private key is the rightful owner. The DAO contract allowed for an outsider to transfer ether out.  Some may not like it, but that is the contract.  If the underlying software is defective, it is the fault of the writers for rolling out software without adequate testing, and the contract holders for choosing an untested platform.  They are free to work it out among themselves. ANY attempt to reverse the contract is a complete embarrassment and a CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF TOTAL FAILURE of ethereum as a cryptocurrency and a contract substrate. In cryptoland, it is not even wrong to take advantage of a bad contract.  By definition, if you can transfer money to your account, it is your right to do so.  Parties with enough hashing capacity to break the network are 'incentivized' (bribed) to maintain security instead, and would in a second switch to the dark side if it were possible and to their advantage.  That is good.  The reason for the stability of a cryptocurrency is not the law, not moral decency, but the physical limitations of this universe.  It is not open to interpretation. I would never, ever invest a penny into any cryptocurrency that is so centralized that a party could routinely or selectively reverses transactions, even if it is by 'consensus'.  A consensus to an action that would indelibly harm everyone, would mean that the majority, for reasons of ignorance, idiocy or insanity, do not understand the rules and the benefits of a distributed cryptocurrency.  The mere ability to do so as (possibly) demonstrated by this fiasco means that my funds could never be safe, the system is centralized, and basically, a scam.

Locking down this hackers' account so he can't spend it is a good idea. That would effectively show that user funds can be frozen by political means.,t3_4oithy,derpUnion
It's not frozen by force in the traditional sense. It is: everyone knows who you are and refuses to do business with you. Individuals can refuse to comply with a soft fork and not be excluded from the network.,t3_4oithy,Rune4444

"Horrible precedent and moral hazard. Ethereum investors, miners and holders as a whole are bearing the costs and repercussions for the actions of those involved in the DAO. What incentive is there for future developers and investors to carefully evaluate the security and operational risks of a project if they know there is a reset button of last resort for bad decisions? Further, there is now the risk of establishing means and method for potential future government intervention. Please let the lessons here be learned by those who should bear responsibilities for them. The problems with the DAO weren't exactly a secret (heck, even the NYTimes covered them) edit: full disclosure - I hold ETH but didn't invest in DAO",t3_4oithy,nikcub

"You could negotiate with the attacker. He can sign a transaction which sends most coins back, maybe some to himself. If everyone agrees, this transactions goes through.",t3_4oithy,seweso
"I agree. The DAO should at least attempt to clean up its own mess before there's any talk of a hard fork. The soft fork, which Ethereum will have to do in order to protect the platform means the attacker gets nothing, so there should be ample reason for both sides to negotiate.",t3_4oithy,BadLibertarian
I don't think many people realize you should be able to negotiate instead of Hardfork.,t3_4oithy,seweso
"I'm wondering how locked up the ETH in the attacker's child DAO really is. If they could send it back to the parent DAO, then it would make sense to put up a bug bounty proposal that pays the attacker's contract some fraction - 1%, .5%, 10%? of the DAO's balance on a specified date (that date being before his lockup for sending the ETH elsewhere expires). So since it would be up the the attacker to determine what that balance would be, I'd expect that all of the ETH would come back. That would be great, because it would require no forks at all (just the credible threat of the soft fork). If there's no way for the attacker to move funds at all until the lockup expires, then that's more problematic, because as soon as they are in a position to honor the deal, they are also in a position to defect. So my suggestion for future DAO contract writers would be - if someone does split, make that decision reversible until the lockup period expires. If that were (or is - I don't know) the case here, then DAO voters should be able to handle these problems themselves, without having to get the platform devs involved.",t3_4oithy,BadLibertarian
This is probably the best idea.,t3_4oithy,[deleted]
The option to defect is easy to eliminate. Soft fork with the rule that the attacker can only execute agreed upon transactions involving the stolen funds. Not very difficult from a development standpoint. Coordinating with negotiations would be by far the harder part.,t3_4oithy,ArticulatedGentleman
"A soft fork isn't so bad, it's ""just policy"". One soft fork which allows coins to move back (or at least 99.9%) and you are done. Then you just wait.",t3_4oithy,seweso
"I agree, but it would be much better imo if the contract itself were coded to allow for that to happen. You'd still need the 'stick' of the soft fork, but you'd at least have a very good chance of avoiding it.",t3_4oithy,BadLibertarian

"Applying any sort fo censorship attacks the fungibility property of ETH.

Destroying fungibility by any form of censorship either due soft/hard fork or due miners confiscation, might make ETH the darling of governments but destoys the very basics why a blockchain based system is made for - censorship resistance. Sacrifying ETH for saving the DAO is similar to what governent do when they think they need to bail out banks. DAO investors accepted a TAC where they agreed to understand the code/project and are aware of involved risks. At the end everybody should have recognized the many red flags from the very beginning (starting with the abuse of a general purpose term for their braggy brand:  ""The DAO - the mother of all DAOs"" - which has now destroyed the term for anybody who liked the basic idea of DAOs, followed by the idea that ""you can only win"" by a rising DAO price and always get out when DAO < ETH promise - no sane person should think win-only/riskless investment exists, they made the trick by externalizing the risk to the ETH holders, exactly the situation we see now, and in general the style of marketing and phantasy overhead).

The developers responding so far are suggesting we firstly soft fork to buy us (from what I can see) an unlimited amount of time to decide what to do. If we want consensus of the community we need the entire community to be aware of what is going on, therefore we need time to inform them and thus 2. is a good idea. The ETH stored in the child DAO contract can all be traced back to it's original owners before it was moved via this vulnerability.

If the proposed hard fork is adopted, then it is a reflexion of a consensus in the community, not a centralized power in action. From an socioeconomic standpoint it is very interesting, because we are exploring the limits of decentralisation. For instance, The bitcoin community struggling to reach consensus, or the DAO governance model that was a MESS, and dind't even arrive to ONE decision. For many things the decentralized model is unfit, for instance all successful companies are heavily centralized (Steve Jobs had the reputation to be a little dictator at Apple.) So yes, the hard fork might be a big blow to the decentralization ideal, but maybe it is because this model is only a mental image, and unfit to the reality. Community consensus might be a way forward It might be a good thing that the community is actually able to make decisions, and take action.

Bitcoin has never hardforked to return money, even after the numerous hacks that have occured. Why hasn't bitcoin done that? Because it breaks the social contract of neutrality.

Now obviously in this case it's reasonably clear that it's been stolen but there seems to be so much potential for abuse to me.

And at first I supported 100% the soft fork that would freeze the funds... But then what did I see? A ""patch"" that allowed for ""anyone to propose a fork""... Seriously WTF here!? From a one-time event, supposed to be totally exceptional due to the insane number of ETHs involved in a contract full of bugs, errors and security holes (apparently there are more bugs leading to exploits in the DAO than the two already published)... This becomes an ""everybody shall be able to suggest soft forks"". Seriously what is wrong with this community? It was supposed something free to use by anyone, in any way they wanted. And now bullshit like ""social consensus"" and ""tirranny of the majority"" would become an integral part of Ethereum? I'm not for the funds to be returned to their owners. I'm not for the DAO to be saved. But now I realized that Ethereum is going to be taken over by same little clique of ""social justice warriors"" and other low-life scum that have basically taken over most of the Internet (including Reddit and now even HN etc.). What's next? Soft forking to punish anyone using Ethereum and saying anything that the little Internet clique doesn't like by blocking their funds / smart contracts?

It is not an arbitrary decision that anyone with some influence can make, the majority of the community has to agree on it. I say 'community' and not miners. Indeed, if a hard fork is proposed, then you will effectively have two version of the ethereum currency. The one that people choose to use, exchanges choose to trade and developper choose to further develop will be the one that holds value. The miners are the primary deciders, but in the end they will mine what the community as a whole wants to use. You can try to propose a hardfork to do whatever you want, I wish you good luck.

"My refund script could've been run already and people could've been refunded. Unfortunately as it doesn't fit into the ""use Solidity contracts for absolutely everything"" view it has been ignored by people in the #extrabal_community. That's not an accurate summation of the problem. Running a script is not the problem; validating the balances and the code to pay them out, and getting all the trustees to agree is. Setting that aside, the fatal flaw with your proposed procedure is that it requires a separate transaction for every entry. Not only is this needlessly expensive in transaction costs, it's totally impractical with a multisig wallet: each of the curators would have to sign over 11,000 transactions. a single contract in Solidity which is supposed to fetch data from another contract storing addresses and values to be refunded, then sending money from the wallet contract to the above mentioned new contract and hope for the best that it will process all 22k transactions in one go. I'm not sure what approach you're trying to summarise here, but the mention of sending 22k transactions doesn't reassure me when there's only ~11k accounts that contributed to the extraBalance.",t3_516xbp,nickjohnson
"At least we're having a conversation. That is much better. Let me say first I do think your approach has some merit, but sending individual transactions the way I've done it is not more expensive when you're actually procuring the values to be sent with another smart contract as opposed to simply load them in. So about your view that sending individual transactions is more expensive I say what do you think about creating a so called (abovementioned) ""sealing the balance contract"" that was most recently done? That contract was created to have the balances of all accounts on the blockchain and inserting it cost 4.4M gas per transaction. If you look at my running costs for example: inserting the transaction: 170715 gas  here confirming for the second time 	35863 gas  here actual refund 35841gas  here So a total of 242412... not that expensive compared to 4.4M per transaction (please note this cost was mentioned on the channel, I haven't verified it myself). Also, I don;t see how sending individual transactions by means of the script is a ""fatal flaw"". I see no problem with signing 11 or 22k transactions when you have an automated way to do so. Specially that as it now appears my approach is least expensive :) As for the number of 22k - this is the number of rows in the data dump posted on the channel and described as accounts to be refunded, if some of those entries should not be there or can simply be aggregated that can be done before the script (or any other means of refund is run).",t3_516xbp,flynth

So a total of 242412... not that expensive compared to 4.4M per transaction (please note this cost was mentioned on the channel, I haven't verified it myself).

I did review it and decided not to use it, and I told you about it straight away. I can see you are eager for it to be used. This is understandable. I also saw your reddit post too, but did not respond yet, maybe I won't respond at all, because I don't really have a lot of time now. As I tried to explain earlier, choosing the approach to refund is a trade-off between usability (for both curators and users), safety (for both curators and users), and ease of approval. I only decided on the token-based approach yesterday. I realised that it has an important safety advantage - users can eliminate the possibility of replays (if they want to) by transferring tokens before the refund. Also, they can test with small amounts. It is based on the refund contract that has been used for theDAO itself and has refunded millions of ETH without being compromised, so I would say that is a big reason to use it. There are other benefits too, but I won't try to describe them all.

I also disagree with some statements made so I was expecting at least a conversation. Now we're having it, so better late that never. Also, I was expecting it was ""set in stone"" that the refunds will be sent to everyone rather than a withdrawal contract everyone has to trigger will be used. I agree a withdrawal contract is better and it is trivial to write it, because a lot of code from the existing withdrawal contract can be reused. I don't think sending many k's of transactions from a contract would be trivial, but everyone has a different definition of that I guess [10:48] That changes things from what was said, so will cause some confusion among non-technical users, but it is a trade-off I could support",t3_516xbp,flynth

The force is with Ethereum and I bet on that when I heavily invested in it. The force was weak with the DAO which became already too big as soon as it crossed the $10 million line. A kid knows not to put all his dollars in one basket... I bought Long Term Values behind Ethereum and its founders. The prospect is amaizing. People looking for a second chance want to get their money back and get out. I want to stay in something I believe in. Let's not kill Ethereum over some third party mistake made on the way to greatness!!",t3_4qhpg7,Nico9111
"People looking for a second chance want to get their money back and get out. This is a great point. People are worries about this setting precedent, which is a valid fear.

My parents held the philosophy that if I fucked up, I should bear the consequences. If I didn't bear the consequence, lesser were the chance of a lesson being learned, higher were the chances of me repeating the mistake.

"Hey really like what you guys are doing but I read this through and have some questions / thoughts. Don't take it personally, I'm really keen to read your proposal and super excited about the backfeed protocol. Before you read through - IMO you guys should work on a proposal to develop your core protocol in the context of an identity system or name service that can be tested out at a smaller scale and then once proven small governance changes may be made over time to the DAO. Is the goal of the DAO to solve complex problems? It seems to me that the goal of the DAO is more to fund the community to solve those complex problems. I believe important tasks that need completing from traditional governance should be done through the proposal system. Just as VCs hire experts to perform due diligence the DAO should as well. The DAO should have a very very simple governance model and buy the advice that the collective agrees is necessary to vet deals. It would make sense to hire multiple high-reputation firms or individuals to perform financial, technical, and legal due diligence prior to the acceptance of any proposal (FYI this is where I feel that the choice to have the proposal submitter decide the voting period is dangerous as it puts too much FOMO on accepting the proposal before any major issues are discovered or addressed.) This is not necessarily true - reputation exists even if it not accounted for - people will vote with their money but the ability to win favour for a particular proposal is primarily reputation based. I think it's dangerous to assume making reputation accountable will address DAO control problems. What progress has backfeed made in testing their protocol our at smaller scales? It seems risky to me that you would apply an experimental governance mechanism to something already highly experimental. The quorum is already designed with this in mind and the curators have the ability to slowly reduce this over time. Since there have been no submitted proposals we have no idea whether that assumption is true or not. Would be interested to see the proposal for this, but IMO the major issue to address here is that there's a single curator with multiple signatories whereas that should be on-chain (multiple independent curators) and the ability to vote them in and out one-by-one. Perhaps we should consider a bounty programme proposal for improved contracts for handling curatorship? I don't think we need an automated / algorithmic version right away.",t3_4khz20,mwilcox
"Hi mwilcox, thanks for your attention and in depth analysis. As stated above, assessing investment proposals in itself is a complex task, which in traditional VC's and investment funds is delegated to expert employees or partners. The expertise of these individuals is the main competitive difference between different investment firms and not some minor feature that can be easily outsourced. If we want to compete with them, we'll have to find something better. However, The DAO could potentially outsource this function, but this would only kick the problem down the road for 2 reasons: a) The fees would probably eat up all ROI and render the whole enterprise pretty redundant b) Deciding which consulting contractor to hire is a complex decision in itself and would encounter similar problems as stated in section 2 an 3. Anyhow you'll need a better problem solving engine Besides, we firmly believe, that with an intelligently designed governance scheme, our crowd wisdom could out-compete traditional investment funds. We really should give this a try. Well, as you've mentioned yourself, this whole enterprise is very experimental in nature. Never before have 160 million USD been managed without corporate structure and/or a board of directors. So we're in good company I guess. Besides, the Backfeed protocol has been implemented in various small scale MVP's like our Magazine and Slant news. The reputation and evaluation dynamics add up pretty well there and for the time speaking we don't see why this couldn't be scaled. Is it frightening? Well, yes. But then again you already have 160Mil$ sitting in an ethereum wallet, waiting to be moved around in ways never before attempted. Besides, the kind of informal reputation you've mentioned above can't really be regarded as a reputation system that addresses the problems we've mentioned. Anyways, nothing will be implemented without running appropriate tests first. It probably is - since it was every time in the past. Just look at the BitShares example or any publicly traded company or even cooperatives. Unincentivized participation tends to vanish. Lowering the quorum is a very bad solution, since it grants a very active and vocal group to become the controlling stake over millions worth of ether. This is the recipe for fraud and corruption. Our reputation proposal for the cuartion mechanism will include an incentive scheme or bounty program, as you're calling it. Anyways, by the beginning of next week we'll have the full proposal so you'll be able to judge it from there. Thanks again for your input, and see you around!

Edit 1: BTW, the point regarding miners is that when the price drops too low, miners leave. And when miners start leaving, the network becomes less secure and easier to 51% attack.

"Looking forward to reading the full proposal. I think you're on the right track but think a slower approach makes sense. The curator centralisation is the biggest governance problem is the biggest danger at this stage, and I was surprised the DAO was launched without more criticism on that point (remember it was originally called serviceProvider). You're probably right that further incentive mechanisms for experts in the community to participate more deeply in proposal analysis would result in safer investments. I think third parties will also need to be contracted for actual company due diligence. I guess my point was more that the projects being funded are experimental. The DAO itself is experimental for sure, that doesn't mean its governance is necessarily a good place to experiment directly. 3/4. Sounds good - will wait to see what you come out with. IMO where you guys would much better fit is in the managing of investments and holding companies to account after a proposal is submitted rather than beforehand. The crowd is pretty good at reviewing things when they are new, but then usually ignore their investment and are surprised when two years later people ran off with the money or spent it all on something else. The DAO is about starting lots of experiments, but there is much more room for experimentation with smaller organisations off the side and keep the core DAO as mechanical as possible (the mother of all DAOs). Work is already being put into making proposals more visible, but reputation, meritocracy and incentivisation should be used to hold companies to account. I think the community has a lot to offer DAO companies in terms of development, testing, trials, recruiting, marketing, documentation, etc., and a reputation system that encourages positive material contributions to DAO companies with open development would be much more beneficial.",t3_4khz20,mwilcox

I suggest you do some reading up on the work that Backfeed is doing - their team has been very involved in the community since the start of 2014.,t3_4khz20,mwilcox

There is proxywithdraw to be able to sign with your keys and have someone else (with a sync'd ETC chain) carry out the withdraw for you. I'd image exchanges might offer such a functionality but I'm not sure how quickly.

IMO, it's a total lose-lose regarding TheDAO exploiters.  If they dump, the price tanks.  If they don't, I still think the price still stays ultra low.

"If the attacker gets away with 3,641,694 ETH, ETH is at least temporarily ruined.  It MAY recover long term but that remains to be seen.  It may never recover. On hack day the volume of ETH traded on Poloniex wasn't even 3.6 million ETH.  This hacker could dump more ETH on the market than the market can handle which drives the price down to nothing. Many people who weren't invested in the DAO may not realize how much this would hurt them. They think only DAO investors are effected. Imagine this scenario: Hacker buys a short position on Poloniex for ETH and DAO. Hacker takes his 3.6 million ETH and starts selling at any price, driving the price of ETH and DAO down. The bots realize something is wrong and they start triggering sales and people's existing stop loss sales go through. This drives the price down more. The ethereum community starts to realize what is happening so more people start buying short positions on Poloniex and selling their ETH holdings. Meanwhile the attacker takes his profits and starts buying back ETH. The news outlets and blogs begin to pickup the story. The general public doesn't really start learning about this until several hours to perhaps a day after it starts. Meanwhile ETH price is way down. Attacker is rebuying cheap ETH with his profits.  He's now got control of even more ETH than he started with.  He can continue to sell down. It doesn't matter if he drives the price to .00001 or whatever because its all free money to him any way and he has already made lots of profits. The news stories get worse at this point. The general public abandons ETH. Miners quit mining ETH as it is no longer profitable. They move elsewhere. Companies no longer want to invest in ETH or our smart contracts. Maybe 6 months or a year later ETH can recover, but chances are another coin will take it's place. ETH will probably never recover. It's not bitcoin. There are a ton of people making alt coins right now. Chances are some of those other coins have potential.  People will look to those coins instead.",t3_4qhpg7,benfitts

We need to get this in the hands of more people, but I can tell you for a fact that most people look at this and see it as too risky.  All they understand is a hack happened, and not that a contract was badly coded.  That mindset will never invest or use this currency if they think it can be ""hacked"" so easily to lose $260M (at the DAO's highest value).

"I think that ultimately Ethereum (and other cryptocurrencies too, but Ethereum IMO has the best technical prospects) is going to be biggest in applications where people won't even necessarily be aware that they're using it. Ethereum's going to be great for programs to use when bargaining with other programs. Cloud storage, distributed computing, video streaming, identity management, token issuance, all of that can be done using Ethereum ""under the hood"" to facilitate interactions and keep things fair and trustable. All the end-user needs to know is that his torrent program downloads new stuff a lot faster if he lets it seed old stuff for a while, banking up tokens (managed via Ethereum behind the scenes) to pay to other seeders for better service. The market price of Ether doesn't really matter, IMO. As long as the price remains relatively stable over the short term and there's a reasonably large and liquid supply sloshing around, programs using Ethereum won't need to hold significant amounts of Ether - they'll buy and spend it as they go. This sort of usage depends on Ethereum being  trustworthy and impartial , and doesn't depend on Ether's long term market price or other such trivialities. That's what I'm hoping to see Ethereum used for in the long run. And that's why it really doesn't matter to me whether investors who only care about whether they can make money trading Ether think. They're not doing anything  interesting  with Ethereum. It's the people who are developing smart contracts for myriad applications who are now going ""wait, should I really be trusting Ethereum to handle this for me?"" that I'm worried about losing.",t3_4qhpg7,FaceDeer

"Agreed. This is actually why I didn't buy all that much during the ICO. It just didn't seem like Ether should even be a currency. I'm still amazed that it's become one (at least in the eyes of many people). But despite the fact that the price of ETH doesn't need to be high (in fact it would be fantastic if it was low, because then we could compute more for cheaper), the reality is that we need the price to be  high enough  to secure the network properly. In other words, if you want to do serious DApps that handle serious assets, then you need the network to be secured by lots of hashing power (at least until PoS), and that means (for now) that a high price has high utility (if only for the miners it attracts).",t3_4qhpg7,commonreallynow
"Certainly, it's a nice-to-have. I've argued against pigeonholing Ether as a non-currency before, and I mentioned in another comment in this thread that if the price cratered low enough even I would crack and buy an unreasonable amount speculatively. :) I think the ""Ethereum is still young"" argument works here. If the price craters for a while, yeah, the network will go through a weak period and that sucks. But there's nothing depending on its strength right at the moment so there'll be opportunity to build it back up again. And serious DApps will create demand for Ether, too, which will drive the price up even if speculation alone doesn't.",t3_4qhpg7,FaceDeer

As would many others, which is why we probably won't get the opportunity when the losing side of this debate rage quits (i.e. it'll probably just be a flash crash as the winning side gobbles it up). The same will likely happen if DAO participants start selling into the wall of pro-forkers excited about Ethereum's future. The only sustained buying opportunity will come from the attacker if they setup a selling bot to repeatedly flood the market, leading more and more people to wonder if Ethereum has become another failed coin.

Also, even in that scenario, the one really losing money would be the counterpart to the 50 million bet. Knowing that there is someone willing to sell a lot of ether, wouldn't it make it harder for the hacker to find a good price for that short?

If I sell something short at 50x leverage thinking that the price will go down, I will lose 100% of my position if it goes up 2% (Even if the price plummets after). The thing is, though, that the attacker can place the short only INSTANTS before burning through the buy orders, meaning he's completely in control. I'm only a novice trader, so I'm not entirely certain who the counterpart is on a short, but I think it's mainly from the exchange lending out assets for a person to sell short. I don't know if the exchange is the loser for whatever is shorted, or if it's the person whose ETH was lent, but no matter who the rube is, the entire ETH environment will be burned bad. I'm not a bitcoin troll or maximalist. In fact, I only bought my first XBTs a few days ago as a divestment from ETH.

I believe that if you are a miner you should thank F2Pool. Thank to them we will be making 15% more profit after the HF (at least temporary). No but seriously what is wrong with these guys? Everyone is trying to provide voting options and they just 'decided' in a roundtable that they are just not gonna do it? Who do they think they are? I advise ANYONE ( pro or against HF) to switch pool. Do you really want to allow a bunch of guys to take decisions for you? You might be opposing this hard-fork but what about if there is another one that you approve ? What if you want the next HF to happen? What about the next mandatory HF for the switch to POS? They will certainly refuse it as they will lose money if there is no POW needed? This makes me scared for Bitcoin as it is in majority mined by Chinese pools ( I'm not saying that all Chinese pools are like this but ... ) Well that's just my opinion anyways and I'm already mining on a pool who gave me the option to vote.

Can you explain me how using the outcome of a voting tool as the default option corresponds to what you are saying?,t3_4t6pmi,dwarfy
"Yes. The idea that carbonvote has any representativity  other  than what the big holders want is ridiculous. Carbonvote tallies ""votes"" by counting how many ETH are held in the addresses that ""voted"". This is exactly how you'd expect a corporation to proceed: the people who own the most voting shares effectively ""control"" the fate of the company. By basing their decisions on Carbonvote, this is the message the Foundation and Ethcore are sending, and it is not irrational of them. Thus, if the ""vote"" reflects the opinion of the rich holders (we're talking tens to hundreds of thousands of ETH here), and the developers use the results as a metric, then they are merely acting upon the will of the few, regardless of what the rest of the holders think. Forcing a fork by default is subversive use of the confidence they have earned in the community and might backfire. The fact is the system is  still  decentralized in theory, but in practice it isn't. I think that's because people aren't used to taking such decisions. You could, today, fire up a miner and take a stand. You could also decide to fork the GitHub source code for geth and Parity and just edit the default-on fork options. The one very very important point to remember, is that even if you do this, you do not have the same power that Ethcore and the Foundation have. Namely, you don't control the communication channels (this sub is moderated by Foundation members for example) and even more importantly, you do not control the software distribution repositories (PPAs for example). This means that even if you fork the github code, it will not be available ""easily"" to the masses, i.e. to anybody doing a ""apt-get upgrade"". It is bullshit I am allergic to, not the fork per se.",t3_4t6pmi,mablap
"Carbonvote tallies ""votes"" by counting how many ETH are held in the addresses that ""voted"" I assume your propose to count differently? May I ask you ""how"" ?",t3_4t6pmi,ravno_108
"What I propose is: ""let's not rush anything anymore"". Soft fork was rushed, and failed. The possibility of fucking up with a HF is absolutely not negligible. A better voting system would require voters to freeze a certain amount of their currency for a period of time. This would mean that ""voting"" is a binding agreement for a set number of days  prior   and   after  the vote. That way, you can't just vote ""PRO-FORK I WANT MY MONEY BACK"" and then play the markets at the same time. If you want to fork, fine, but the funds you used to vote will be locked up for some X amount of time after the fork, forcing you to consider your options much more carefully. An even better voting system could take into account the distribution of wealth by having a public register of signatures (just like with PGP) which could then be used in a multi-sig. This means that huge decisions like this do not depend on the will of the few rich holders, but rather on a plurality of holders, no matter how rich they are. The current fork might just work and everything will be in order without a single problem. But under the current priors, I see no way of this happening, thus I find the whole idea of a HF (and implementing it so fast) to reflect carelessness.",t3_4t6pmi,mablap
"Thanks for the ideas. I would say, that under scenario 1. no one would vote at all. For the 2. not sure if I got you right. You want to give the same voting weight for the people owning (as an example) 100.000 ETH and for those having 100 ETH ?",t3_4t6pmi,ravno_108
"You're welcome :) I would say, that under scenario 1. no one would vote at all. If you are right, then the current scenario where a lot of people are pushing for a rushed hard fork is quite telling of their carelessness. If they aren't willing to put forward a portion of their holdings to support their ideas, then they either have nothing to lose either way, or haven't really thought through the implications. For the 2. not sure if I got you right. You want to give the same voting weight for the people owning (as an example) 100.000 ETH and for those having 100 ETH ? Yes. Otherwise you have a corporation controlled by majority shareholders, not a ""decentralized platform"". Note that this wouldn't be a problem at all if carbonvote was not used by top players such as the Foundation and Ethcore to justify their choice of defaulting to pro-fork. Currently the miners can still choose to fork or not, so it is in fact ""decentralized"" but the fact that the defaults are pro-fork is a giveaway of centralized decisions.",t3_4t6pmi,mablap

I'm not saying it is a requirement - I'm merely arguing that, to get a more representative view of the  general  opinion about the fork, and not only that of whales, you'd need to force people to lock up their funds. Would you really see someone locking up 8 million ethers for a week just to vote yes? If you did, there would be no question that person is convinced of their choice. At the moment, you can put 8 mil into the YES vote and hedge your position on fork day with the  entirety  of your assets, AND you'll even get to have twice the ETHers. This is a win-win situation for them. I want the votes to be correlated to the ETH which every voter posses. Otherwise anyone who doesn't want the ETH to prosper will buy 0.01 ETH on 1000 accounts and will vote ""no"" and have more impact than me with 1000 ETH. See it? Yes, this is precisely why I suggested (in my grandparent post) that a public registry of signatures be kept, and that multisigs be used to take such big decisions. That way, it doesn't matter how much ETH you own. The problem is not in the voting system  per se  - it is inconsequential in absolute. The problem lies in the dissonant argumentation put forward by the pro-forkers, twisting the meaning of for example carbonvote, and using their own definitions of ""democracy"". If the vote was democratic, it would be one person one vote. For now, Ethereum is run as a corporation, where whoever has the most shares gets their say. I'm not saying this is inherently bad - they can do what they want with their baby. Merely pointing out the dissonance and distortion of ideas. (Another example is that I was mocked for calling this HF a ""bailout"" and people who put money in the DAO ""speculators"", which are both the correct terms. In the first case, the DAO speculators will get their money back after making a bad investment that threatened (per them) the stability of the Ethereum ecosystem. In the second case, a whole lot of people pouring money in the DAO did so for speculation, as is evident by the fact that $150 mil USD were stacked in an easily exploitable contract. Due diligence would have meant exercising caution, using test contracts, etc before jumping on the bandwagon to make a quick buck.)",t3_4t6pmi,mablap

DAO contains one or more malicious attackers:  If no white hat attackers exist in the child DAO then they will hopefully enter it as described  here . The white hat and malicious attackers will almost definitely be locked in an indefinite battle of splits/exploits, locking up the underlying Eth. If no white hat attacker enters the the malicious attacker gets the balance of the child DAO. The 3.6M Eth dark DAO, of course, falls under  2 . There are possible malicious attackers in the white hat DAOs which means they probably fall under  2  as well.

Any attempt by the white hat attackers to refund the tokens in the child DAOs could be thwarted by said malicious attackers.

It's not even surprising the majority of the 4.5MM who have voted are in favour of a refund (it's extremely likely they are all DAO holders). It is not representative of all ETH holders. Pushing a contentious hard fork and attacking people for their free choice is incredibly bad for everyone, and all decentralised cryptocurrency. And trying  again  to capitalise by attacking Bitcoin is disgusting behaviour. If most of the ETH coin hodlers agreed to hard fork, then there would be clear consensus, but as it stands, Ethereum community cannot demonstrate a clear consensus on this matter. Maybe DAO holder's consensus is more clear, but this hard fork is about changing the rules of ETH and should involve all the users. In my opinion, f2pool are making the right choice - miners do not decide hard forks, users do. There is no way for them to see that the vast majority of coin holders want the change, therefore it's contentious and they should continue the status quo. If their customers disagree with them, they will lose hash rate, but the fact f2pool hash rate has not decline so far is a fair indication about how their miners feel (which is either agnostic or in agreement). While I fully expected to be attacked for daring to speak out and accused of somehow being biased because I am a contributor to Bitcoin Core; the points I make applicable to any decentralised cryptocurrency. However, it seems very common in the Ethereum community, much like in the Bitcoin community, for people who disagree with controversial hard forks to be vilified by all and any means possible.",t3_4t6pmi,btcdrak

"Yup, I have been with ETH since the crowdsale, and I feel exactly the same way.  I can understand the arguments against the hard fork, and agree up to a point, but I know deep down that without a hard fork, ETH is dead. Here's how this debacle looks to a ""mainstream"" human: Participants in the largest crowdfund in history had money siphoned out of their account by one (or two, if you count the white hats) fellow member, the ETH community knew  exactly  where stolen funds were stored, the developers came up with a system to return the money without having to revert transactions that weren't directly related to the attack, but ultimately decided that it was better to let the attacker keep the coins; those people will just move along to another system, or wait patiently for smart contracts to be deployed on a ""reliable"" system (be it Bitcoin or w/e new system comes along, maybe even a forked, revamped, relaunched Ethereum). A hard fork might ultimately cost the network it's credibility in the long-term, but doing nothing destroys that credibility immediately.  At least it kills it for me, and I am about as heavy of a believer as they come.",t3_4qhpg7,lazyj2020

"I think it's great that we're getting a wide range of behaviors for what is effectively an experiment Bitcoin as a whole is unwilling to try. I've mentioned before that the only way a HF can results in both sides existing for any length of time is if the losing side is sticking to their guns out of ideology/principle and is willing to take a potentially dramatic loss for it. Here, F2Pool is playing the part of the blockstream diehards, and certainly seems to channel the ideology/principle required for that scenario. If nobody was willing to play that role, the HF could end up working out too smoothly, and not being as interesting of an experiment. So bring on the opinionated mining pool!

If we can find some, we'll repeat it as loudly and often as we can to prove the righteousness of our cause. Failing that, we'll come up with a number of reasons why this experiment is deeply flawed and its results cannot in any way be useful to predict anything about what would happen to another HF. It doesn't have to be true or correct, as long as we can drown out the opposition into thinking there's consensus for our side. But I don't care, I'm still curious.",t3_4t6pmi,itsnotlupus

If you mine as a hobby, your principles could easily outweigh your desire for predictable payouts. It's like growing dope for a hobby.

"What percentage of coins from the yes-camp is held by foundation members? This is just a vote by the foundation, acting like they are neutral but still trying to decide the outcome with their coins.",t3_4t6pmi,apoefjmqdsfls
"At the beginning of 2016, the Ethereum Foundation had roughly 2.25 million ETH. About half of that is held in  http://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae . This address did not vote on Carbonvote. I don't know about the other half of their funds. About 4.5 million ETH voted on Carbon Vote. The current total supply is about 82 million ETH. Turnout was about 5.5%. The Foundation could have accounted for no more than 27 % of that vote if all of their unaccounted funds voted. If that were the case, then the vote would have been about 2.8 million to 0.6 million, or 82% in favor, instead of 87% in favor. However, I would be very surprised if the Foundation voted, as many statements were made saying that all opinions expressed were those of individuals, not the Foundation or the Ethcore team or whatever as organizations. If you're asserting that some of the people who are also Foundation members may have voted (e.g. Vitalik and Gavin), then you may be right. However, I would counter that their opinion matters, and that the importance of an individual's opinion to the hard fork is reasonably well approximated by how much Ether they control.",t3_4t6pmi,jtoomim

"ETH deposits and withdrawals will be disabled approximately 1 hour before the hard fork activates. Trading will continue as normal during the fork. All ETH on Kraken after the fork will be tokens of the winning chain (i.e. the chain with the most work on it). ETH deposits and withdrawals will be enabled again once the winning chain has become clearly evident. http://blog.kraken.com/post/147619017767/on-the-ethereum-hard-fork Let's say Kraken has just three customers -- Fred, Freida and Frank.  Prior to the fork Fred has a 100 ETH balance, Freida has 0, and Frank has 1 Bitcoin.   Exchanges will feel lots of pressure to allow ETH deposits and withdrawals ASAP.  So let's say Kraken decides that the hard fork with 75% after six hours makes it ""clearly evident"" that the hard fork is the winning chain and they then begin allowing ETH deposits and withdrawals.   So Freida, a miner, then deposits 80 of her newly mined, post-fork ETH into Kraken.   Then she withdraws it.  Kraken pays Freida from their ""working wallet"" which happened to have been Fred's deposit from prior to the fork. Then the hard fork drops to having only 25% of mining support.  Eventually (maybe another six hours), the original chain overtakes the hard fork.  The transactions (including Freida's 80 ETH deposit) no longer exist on the chain having the most work. Kraken is then left with only 20 ETH in their wallet, plus the 1.0 Bitcoin.   But Fred's account shows 100 ETH owed him.   Kraken is then technically bankrupt.   In bankruptcy, (at least in the U.S.,) all creditors get an even haircut.  So if the total assets (1.0 bitcoin plus 20 ETH) combined equals $1,000, Fred's claim gets about $620 and Frank's claim gets about $380 (i.e., an amount less than 1.0 Bitcoin) But wait .... Frank held only Btcoins ... and never touched ETH.  What's going on???   Doesn't matter!   He takes a haircut just like every other Kraken creditor.

You simply don't know where they are, or how to contact them. That means a significant hash power is going to continue on the current chain.

Blockchains require a significant majority to form in order to fork.  51% is a term of art.  A successful hard fork requires more than 51% hashpower to have a good chance of success.

Anyways, the body of the post actually doesn't talk down to people in any way. It's factual and could be helpful. In particular, it makes 3 important contributions: It links to an easy-to-understand, very persuasive and motivating video showing how and why Wall Street is already using functional languages for smart contract language design It emphasizes that the real reason why functional languages should be used is because they're the only languages which support  program verification , which is essential for high-value mission-critical projects such as smart contract language design It points out how functional languages are similar to things people are already familiar with (like solving equations or using an ""=IF()"" formula in Excel), and how the syntax of functional languages often looks pretty much the same as procedural languages (so functional languages actually aren't that hard to learn). Regarding the charges of elitism: I think it's important for procedural programmers to get a whiff of just how much they really  are  looked down upon by functional programmers. This is a very real phenomenon, and the more they're aware of just how disrespected they are, the better. The difference between these two types of languages isn't just something that can be brushed off as a difference in taste, and it's not something where we should be trying to avoid hurting people's feelings - it is the difference between safe and unsafe code. At this point in history, when humanity is beginning to confront the monumental question of whether to design smart contracts using procedural or functional languages, it is crucial for people to understand not only how dangerous procedural languages actually are - but also get some clues as to the reasons why so many programmers haven't bothered to switch from them yet. For example, it's fascinating to see a procedural programmer citing the fact that ""you can go down into assembly"" as if that were somehow relevant to this debate - when he's trying to use that questionable ""benefit"" to argue against languages that actually provide a real benefit that's incalculably greater:  functional languages allow you to prove that programs are correct. And finally, after a quarter billion dollars just vanished because lackadaisical apathetic unaware procedural programmers  still  don't ""get"" why functional languages are mandatory for these kinds of things, then a certain amount of elitism / talking-down-to is probably quite justified.",t3_4p8cft,ydtm

"But this is something that's already been said for decades - and hasn't really worked. It hasn't worked for decades - and it didn't work yesterday, in that chat with that dev - who  still  was being all calm and nice, feeling like he'd done absolutely nothing wrong - when his incorrect smart contract language design had just caused tens of millions of dollars in losses. The goal (in the OP title) was to examine the unexamined thoughts of the programmers who have consistently ignored such warnings and recommendations - while also providing another angle on some of the advantages of functional languages (maybe for the laypeople who might be more receptive to hearing about this than that dev himself). I think we're seeing that a lot of laypeople weren't even aware that there is a major controversy going on between the functional and procedural languages schools. So hopefully the title will let laypeople know that procedural programmers aren't even really  listening  to functional programmers at all, and they aren't even remotely informed about the issues involved (safety) and the solutions readily available (program verification) - they never have been, and they  still  aren't, even on the day after their incorrect smart contract language design lost tens of millions of dollars for people. So, in a way, this is a  cultural  issue - hence yet another mere scientific title like ""Why we need Smart Contracts running on a Functional Programming Language"" probably would be insufficient. I mean, if you read the links at the start of the OP, you'll see that the procedural programmer working on smart contract language design (Solidity) - was being both  nice  and  unapologetic  and even  boastful   after  the DAO had already been drained of tens of millions of dollars - merely saying (not even really bothering to insist) that  ""Solidity is the best damn smart contracting language on the market right now"" , like some kind of cool laid-back dude you might want to have a beer with. So in a way, what I'm really getting at here is: at least I  know  I'm being an asshole (as the top-voted in this thread correctly observed) - but I'm also pointing towards the right solutions. Meanwhile, the dev I'm criticizing  doesn't  know he's being an asshole - because even after his incorrect language design caused tens of millions of dollars, he acted like he'd done nothing wrong, and very  nicely  said  ""Solidity is the best damn smart contracting language on the market right now"" . So I really tried hard to figure out a way to say: ""Hey this guy is nice but he's so stupid that he not only didn't know that he didn't know anything about smart contract language design  before  the DAO died - he still doesn't know that he doesn't know anything about smart contract language design  after  the DAO died - and he doesn't even have the decency to show some contrition.""

What do you think about this? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGlObhGhoEizBXC30Ww4h1KHKGkmcy4NiCKitIBqiUg/edit#heading=h.gm4egb3ql9ps and this: http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/234939/234939.pdf,t3_4p8cft,dezrambson
"The PDF seems interesting, and I intend to sit down with it when I have time and read it closely - mainly because it's based on Idris, a language with dependent types which I've heard a lot about, so I am hoping this would be a useful approach. But then, apparently the author of the PDF said that there were some problems due to a kind of mismatch between the language proposed in the PDF, and the EVM itself: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p5g0k/future_of_ethereum_functional_over_procedural/d4i66mw This has been the first time that I've ever heard anyone say that there might be a problem  with the design of the EVM itself  - and when programmers who understand dependent types talk, I think it's generally worth paying close attention to them. Regarding the Google Doc, I've skimmed it, and it seems interesting for several reasons: Lucius Gregory Meredith before is one of the smartest guys in theoretical (and practical!) computer science around. The fact that he's looking into this is very encouraging. It's also encouraging that they're thinking of introducing a notion of ""behavioral types"" - which is probably necessary given the fact that we're dealing not only with processes but also with data here. (I assume that ""behavioral types"" would complement ""data types"". Most people are familiar with ""data types"", and rarely one hears about ""process types"" - which I imagine is another name for ""behavioral types"" here.) The fact that they're talking about Girard's linear logic also seems very promising - because this is a  resource-conscious  logic, which I imagine would make it in some ways similar to Ethereum, with its notion of ""running out of gas"". I suspect this approach in the Google Docs paper may involve an area called ""co-algebra"" - because co-algebra introduces a notion of ""process types"" which are dual to the ""data types"" of algebra. So... it looks like they're heading in the right direction - but I expect there will be many challenges - because when you're dealing with not only ""data types"" but also ""behavioral types"" (which I think are the same thing as the ""process types"" of co-algebras)... you're talking about cutting-edge research, with only a small number of practitioners able to deal with this stuff. I certainly am not one of them - I merely am fascinated by it and try to keep up as much as I can - but I've had a really, really hard time grasping ideas involving ""process types"" which I believe are like the ""behavioral types"" they're talking about - even though I've tried to study co-algebra a bit over the years. It's just very foreign to me, since I haven't had much exposure to it, and I suspect there has been very little discussion of it among most mathematicians and programmers. So I think what we're seeing here, overall, is that if we want to program ""smart contracts"", and we want them to be safe, then we're obviously going to have to consider using functional languages (because those are the only ones where program verification is practical - you can't do it using procedural languages)... but in addition, we're going to have to consider not only data types from algebra (which pretty much every knows about), but also behavioral types (process types from co-algebra?) - which is pretty advanced stuff. So this will be very challenging. I am however very encouraged to see the many talented people (from the worlds of functional programming, verified programming, type theory) contributing to this area, now that Ethereum has become available as the first major platform for smart contracts. Sorry I can't give more specific answers - as I said, this is really, really advanced stuff (Idris, behavioral types, linear logic), so I'm not qualified to do much more than sit on the sidelines and cheerlead for these guys. Also as I said: I think they're on the right track, simply because while I'm not able to use the tools they use (Idris, behavioral types, linear logic), I'm pretty sure that those  are  the right tools for the job - based on the results I've seen over the years from other people applying these sorts of tools to really complicated stuff. And smart contracts in and of themselves probably  won't  turn out to be all that complicated. By that I mean: when you come down to the bottom line, it's pretty much only Agents sending Resources to each other. This is a lot less complicated than many other areas of math and programming. But the hard part is making sure this stuff is safe (if want to be able to say ""code is law""), and dealing with the aspects involving time, messaging, parallelism, concurrency, etc.",t3_4p8cft,ydtm

You sound like that guy who lost his keys one night at the dark end of a street, but is looking for them under the lamp post because there's more light there. I guess the point of my argument is: if you design a contract language that's not functional, because you think you need to do things like changing state and mutating data, then that contract language is probably doomed. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3722084/does-functional-programming-avoid-state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and  avoids changing state and mutable data. Yes I'm basically saying your whole approach (using mutable state variables in the first place) is wrong, so the only realistic option you have is  throwing out your whole approach. Either you trash your approach, or hackers will trash it for you - like the DAO hacker just did. And I've looked at the yellow paper for the EVM, and I couldn't imagine trying to develop on top of that mass of needless and arbitrary complexity. I'm starting to get the impression that the EVM itself may be the problem.",t3_4p8cft,ydtm
Then i guess you're wasting time here. Door's right there.,t3_4p8cft,VoR0220
"I'm only wasting my time with  you  - but not with some of the other people who have been discussing this stuff with me. (Basically they fall into two groups: laypeople who had no idea that there is a whole programming community that scoffs at the very idea of using a non-functional language for high-value mission-critical projects, and advanced programmers who totally agree with what I'm saying - many of whom are already designing smart contract languages using functional languages). Anyways, I have a bit of free time at the moment which I can choose to use to point out the flaws in the smart contract language design approach taken by the developers who gave us Solidity. Frankly I'm surprised that you don't welcome this sort of very specific criticism - where my so-called ""personal attacks"" on you have actually been rather mild - merely calling you ""lackadaisical"", ""unaware"", ""unapologetic"", ""boastful"", ""apathetic"", ""acquiescent"" - which I think is perfectly justified after the language you helped design caused tens of millions of dollars in potential losses, and even after this you still insisted on claiming that it was the ""best damn smart contracting language on the market right now"" - which is demonstrably false, as anyone can see by watching  the 20-minute video above  talking about smart contract languages being used now on Wall Street which do  not  have bugs, because they support  program verification  - and now when you're basically saying ""because the underlying machine mutates state variables, we have no alternative, we can't design a functional language on top of that (and by the way I think you're wrong there - see below). It's not like I'm just saying ""Solidity suxx"" - the whole time I've been also saying ""here's the alternative you should be using: functional programming which supports formal methods for program verification"". This is a very specific criticism and recommendation. You did address it somewhat - by mentioning that you needed to deal with mutating state variables. I would suggest that as a result of this discussion, we have found an important thing to focus on:  mutating state variables . So the question would be right now: Can a functional language (which does  not  mutate state variables) be built on top of a (virtual) machine that  does ? I would assume the answer is ""yes"" - since there are many functional languages out there, and they all eventually compile down to run on x86 assembly language (which obviously mutates state variables all the time). This may be the crux of the whole language design issue here. I'm quite willing to say that it would be hard for me to design a functional language to run on a machine language that mutates state variables - which is why I'm not attempting such a task. In a way, it's great that you have accepted such a challenge - but in a way it's actually not (if you're not actually up to it). Neither one of us is  Martin Odersky  (the language designer who invented Scala) or  Anders Hejlsberg . You might be a good programmer, but maybe we should consider the possibility that until a smart contract language designer comes along like one of those guys above, then DAOs are going to continue to get hacked. As a concrete suggestion: I think the book ""The Definition of Standard ML"" is a great tool for learning about functional language design. It's very short and sweet, and there are plenty of accompanying materials - ranging from tutorials, to open-source compilers, to program verification tools. ML is a successful project (it gave rise to Ocaml - the language used in  the video linked in the OP , by programmers designing smart contract languages for Wall Street). So basically what I'm saying is:if Solidity tried to be ML-like, and not JavaScript-like, then we could do things like mathematically  prove  (in advance), that future DAOs written in Solidity could not be hacked. And I think ML is simple enough - and well-documented enough - that it would be worth looking into. But don't just look at the basics of writing programs and compilers - also look at the formal tools for program verification that it supports. That's the prize.",t3_4p8cft,ydtm

"You are correct.  Under that line of thinking I think it'd be fair to say that I'm to blame.  I read through the source and didn't catch the bug. I just wanted to highlight that the statements ""X caused Y"" and ""X shares some responsibility for Y"" are very different. I admittedly did say  ""The solidity devs did not cause this bug""  which is slightly inaccurate since it's within reason to say that the language design contributed to the bug.  I don't necessarily agree with this line of thinking because there is a long list of things that contributed in some minor way.  If we want to talk about blame then I'm of the opinion that it should be constrained to those who contributed the most, and in my view, that responsibility rests on the contract authors and the team which performed the security audit. Either way, there is a good conversation happening  on github  and if you have constructive thoughts on how we can alter solidity to make it better I think you should join that conversation.",t3_4p8cft,pipermerriam

"I think you're over simplifying things which is where we'll disagree. I'll try and answer a few points but it'd be much easier in person. the biggest selling point of the blockchain technology: the immutability Well... I'm not sure that's true. The selling point is decentralisation, with the result that the state of the chain is agreed by consensus. Immutability is a product of that but it is not an essential part. Blockchains are a data structure, a tool. Immutability is there for a purpose but it is not an all encompassing law of physics. Let's say a common wallet contract used by 95% of participants was found to have a bug leading to all those ether being stolen, but in a way that could be revoked within 40 days. I'd say immutability at that would be of zero use to the system and sticking to the rule would destroy it entirely. It's an extreme example but note that this is a very possible one, and it demonstrates that immutability is  not  the biggest selling point, or rather that it's not a law of physics. DAO is created, and the ETH founders put a ton of ETH in it as investment. This is factually incorrect. I got annoyed at one or two individuals who persisted in spreading that rumour without any evidence. In fact, several people in the community are aware of the big dao holders but you're not going to find that information on Reddit or in public. DAO code is shit. I've been a programmer for 20 years, and the mistake that started this whole debacle is amateur at best, borderline moronic. Disclaimer: I have not read the code, but I read the exploit. C'mon, letting a transaction send money without deducting it before from the sender is just so damn stupid that it's hard to even explain it. On the one hand yes, it's crap. On the other hand the multiple exploits used were not found in many weeks of the code being public and were just 'being' discovered at the time the exploit happened. I'm afraid it's too easy to say the code was crap. Actually, reading that code it's quite difficult to spot many of these problems. Also, the Solidity documentation did not make explicitly clear certain dangers, and there have been arguments that the EVM itself should have had stronger rules on reentrancy (tho this was only one of the problems). The ""thief"" uses the contract system to funnel money in a legal (as in, the code allowed it, therefore it was legal since the ""code is law"") way. If you consider code is law then yes. That's completely impractical for any meaningful purposes, without mathematical or perhaps reputational proofs. Not only is code very hard to do without bugs but hardly anyone is qualified to know if the code is ok (actually, no one) but I can just code in a 'legal' exploit. That's bad for everyone except me. Now this will happen I'm sure but if you see code as law then frankly it's fucked. The first proposed fix was so rushed out that it could have led to a DDoS attack. That's not good coding, and the code is what your money resides on.. The attack vectors were considered but insufficiently, yep. That's one of the takeaway lessons for sure. We went from a very idealistic idea (code is law, blockchain immutable) to just another shitcoin. You're throwing away the baby with the bathwater there. Think of it in this way: what's separating us from Dogecoin? The contract system? But we just proved that the contracts are mutable, as long as they affect the big pocket people. I don't have the figures at hand but weren't there thousands of dao funders? That's not big pocket people. It's a myth that it took big pockets to make this happen. Frankly, they could afford to lose the money (not that they'd want to) but it's Ethereum investment that would have taken the hit, something I know 100% with regard to at least some the big guys. I think you had a very idealistic view of Ethereum which perhaps was missing some pragmatism. It's really not changed. We're not going to see lots of hard forks changing contracts. We've seen that it's possible but also extremely difficult and with risks. Getting the community to do another one is probably going to need an even more exceptional case, like the one at the start of my post - and it would need the money to be retrievable (exchange thefts currently won't allow that). The use cases for Ethereum haven't changed either. Sleep on it, come back tomorrow, and as long as the HF is stilll ok (fingers crossed) you'll honestly find things haven't changed other than a bunch of very hard lessons have been learned. Edit: Ethereum's power  is  in the smart contracts  and  the community. Also, Dogecoin - it's power is in the community, not the technology. In no case is the power about immutability, that's just a facet which, just like bitcoin's 21 million cap, is actually mutable given sufficient motivation. The ideal isn't law is code (or immutability) - that's a horrendous idea as it turns out. The ideal is that the code I expect to run  is  the code that runs, that amends the data, that allows us to move tokens around the system with accompanied rules. This way I don't need to trust code running on Amazon. However, I still need to trust the code has been written to perform as I'd expect it. It's all about utility and benefits. The end game is not law is code and it's not immutability and it's not a 21 million cap. They're simply features.",t3_4ts2ph,newretro

"I disagree with the doomsday like tone of this post. Technical: There is a plan to overcome the security challenges. Also the DAO will hire security pros/devs who will work constantly on improving security/functionality of The DAO framework. See proposals from Slock.it and the Curators . Regulatory: the DAO.link law firm in Switzerland will take care of this. Stephan mentioned in an interview that he had spoken with German/French/Swiss lawmakers who all had expressed their support. If the members pay their taxes the regulators will support The DAO. Governance: a simplified voting system is already in works from Slock.it. What we badly need is a discussion forum where only DAO members could participate(anonymously) but with an indication how much stake they hold. With this we can prevent outsiders setting the tone of the internal communications and not letting them to purposefully derail/hijack the discussions. At this time we have no way of knowing that the negative FUD-posts here on reddit really come from DAO token holders or from people who would like to see The DAO to fail (e.g. BTC enthusiast/ETH shorters/other token holders/trolls) and who purposefully inject their poisonous venom here disguised as ""only talking about concerns or risks"". Investments: many have invested millions of $ into this project they are serious investors whose vote will count.

"• Technical: what you are suggesting is a centralised solution to a complex technical problem. I agree with you, it surely could be fixed. That is why I suggest the Moratorium. However, whether we like it or not, there is no solution on the table that is decentralized. Curators, hires, other company, etc are all very centralized. Even in this very specific problem that is the domain of computer science, where this crowd has a comparative advantage, theDAO shows its deficiencies as a decentralized decision process mechanism. Now, to avoid the principal-agent problem, those experts should not have a conflict of interest. Emin is a Cornell professor with a strong incentive to be careful with his reputation. The curators involved have the incentive of avoiding legal liabilities and a potential damage to the Ethereum project. I think their incentives and those of theDAO participants are aligned, or at least not in opposition. On the other hand, Slock.it is a company that is also pitching for a contract with theDAO, this rules out its further involvement in any way with theDAO governance. • Regulatory: again, you are suggesting a centralized solution to a complex technical problem. I agree again: theDAO needs a very specific legal expertise that the crowd simply does not have. However, we face again the same principal-agent problem and we need to apply the same caveats. DAO.LINK also has a conflict of interest given its apparent commercial ties with Slock.it, which rules it out as part of the solution. Actually, regulatory risk is, imo, the major risk to this project, maybe at the same level of a complete technical failure. TheDAO is going to start operations under a mix of qualified and unqualified random opinions on a very technical legal matter. • Governance. I think you are confusing political rights with sound decision making. Political rights do not guarantee good decision making, those are two very different utility functions. Good decision making is about the quality of the opinions of those that participate. Increasing the number of unqualified opinions does not increase the quality of the decision. Owning more tokens does not make your more qualified in computer security or in international financial regulation. I know, we would all like to know everything about everything, but we don't. There is a big difference between having the right to be wrong and having the knowledge to be right. Additionally, real life problems are complex multivariate decisions. Currently, theDAO only allows for a binary yes/no mechanism that can only be applied to very simplistic situations. That is why the participants naturally seek outside expertise and a holistic approach to a security, legal or any other complex decision. • Investments: The Wisdom of the Crowds is no more than an application of the law of large numbers. It works in very specific situations, where there is already some wisdom and the estimation error is not biased. Under these assumptions, the average of the sample is a good estimator with confidence increasing with the sample size. However, the law of large numbers is not magic, it does not create knowledge out of nothing. If the crowd does not have the knowledge, increasing the sample size does not increase the quality of the outcome. Otherwise, science would make progress just by asking a large number of individuals. Private investments is a very specific knowledge domain that requires a number of technical skills that go beyond mere intuition. Conducting a due diligence, negotiating contracts, executing transactions and managing financial exposures are not trivial exercises that can be reduced to simplistic yes/no questions. They require multivariate solutions with specific expertise. This is a reality that anybody with real world experience knows. This experiment is apparently designed by people with no direct knowledge of the specific requirements of professional investing, under the assumption that somehow everything is going to be magically sorted out. Well, it wont, and it will become clear very soon. As in any other domain, the crowd will make wise investment decisions only if the crowd has investment wisdom. Finally, you have made relevant comments. However, for some reason, you have not been able to avoid the ad-hominem attacks. My persona or my motivations are irrelevant to the arguments above. I wish I had the solutions. For now, imo, this has to remain a small scale experiment until we find them. I know, it sounds harsh, but closing your eyes and hoping for the best does not change reality.",t3_4ljp5i,Si8Pa
"Thanks for your constructive approach. Some level of centralization will and must always remain for The DAO IMHO because of the human factor. We are not yet at the point of technical evolution that machines/programs could autonomously decide in investment matters. Maybe some AI in the future will be able to do so but right now it's not possible. However even the smartest minds on the planet(e.g. Stephen Hawking) are warning us not to let this to appen. The CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk is investing $1B in the research of ""good"" AIs. So dreaming about complete decentralization and autonomous decision making of The DAO is unrealistic IMHO and must not happen even in the future. I agree with you owning more DAO tokens does not make one a computer expert. However the rules of the game are so that if you own more you have more weight in decisions.  The case for security should be made so that even a non-tech savvy member could understand and make right decisions. Governance: I disagree with you. With the Curators and the voting system there is already a governance structure in place. Investments: there will be no way around for The DAO to hire experts and who will analyze the 1000s of investment proposals and make the case for the best ones to the members. It will once again introduce a level of centralization but if we free ourselves from the notion of ""complete decentralization"" it won't be hard to swallow.

"I will not be voting for this proposal because as it stands it is just a survey poll with a plea for the curator to take control and exercise power beyond their role. I have comments on your concerns: • Technical: The Slock.it proposal fixes almost all attack vectors outlined by Vlad except two of them (the most complex and unlikely ones I would say). Why is no moratorium supporter admitting that? • Regulatory: we knew The DAO was in regulatory hole since the beginning. How is it suddenly becoming something that we should panic over to the point of freezing? • Investment: This is not news, it was clear from day one. And the purpose of The DAO is to navigate through proposals of varying qualities.  Why are we suddenly not trusting the token holders any more to vote on proposals? I disagree that this is a call for responsibility. It sounds more like panic from people would did not realize what they were going into. I'm all for fixing the security issues outlined by Vlad but this should NOT mean we give control to the curators. Play by the rules of The DAO: -Submit a proposal with code enforcing a time framed moratorium so that holders can actually vote on it without losing control (I could vote for that) -Or advertise a moratorium so that people vote NO to everything for a while But don't have the holders lose control to the curators, because in a decentralized context, that sounds more like a call for irresponsibility.",t3_4ljp5i,BGoodej

I also have no idea how to get it controlled back. My intuition says that only with a meticulously prepared plan it can work. Reason says that there are no entities that have both skills and wishes to do it. While I started digging deeper in the whole DAO issues (pretty long time ago) I realized that there are many variables that must be collapsed into constants before it can work as expected.

"With connection to points outlined by OP the possible plan mentioned above should be structured as follows (IMHO): Technical These issues can be split into two categories: Deficiencies and risks in software that constitutes the base for all DAO operations There are lots of issues there. A fraction of them I covered here: [Mist/geth deficiencies] ( https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-mist-geth-hack-urgently-needs-our-attention-again/3082/29 ). More in-depth analysis or independent audit should be performed. Deficiencies and risks regarding voting and contract structure.   This was allegedly addressed by audit performed by DejaVu, however I couldn't find any detailed and properly structured report with risks assessed, tests performed and methodology described. I saw that four of issues addressed by Moratorium document is addressed by Slock.it newest proposal. With no fee. Wow! I would like to know whether any simulations were performed to prove that this solves the case of possible attack vectors without opening new ones. If so, where are these simulations results? If there are none no steps should be taken before such tests are performed. I cannot also duck the issue that Slock.it should not be a judge in own case in terms of security. Thus if no better alternative is available at least a kind of deeper analysis of potential consequences should be performed. Ideally a full fledged and transparent audit should take place. Risks regarding scalability and performance  - these are still partly unresolved despite many attempts. While light client seems to be some kind of temporary solution, sharding looks promising there are security issues connected with these solutions. Together with development of these techniques in-depth security analysis should be performed. Regulatory This area is both the most important and most risky. Meanwhile all discuss about it drowns in a flood of bullshit like ""the truth is in code"". It's always a matter of interface between blockchain and material reality. This interface is hard to be established. I have written a lot about it here: [The legal status of the DAO] ( https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-legal-status-of-the-dao/81 ) . I think that there are some possible areas that should be analyzed. Some ways to consider for example: Real incorporation in permissible jurisdiction  - despite it seems to be impossible there are many small countries that can be convinced to accept a new form of company that would be a real life mirror of a DAO. In return for some yearly fixed tax for instance. Such jurisdiction should be both stable and recognized internationally. Hacking existing legal system with legally proper corporation scheme  - jxstarr described [here] ( https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-legal-status-of-the-dao/81/173 ) his experiment. It has all tenets to be recognized as a company. While it is still crippled in terms of law it could potentially be tested in the court. IMHO worth trying.  Disinterest  - even an explicit disinterest expressed officially by any jurisdiction could be beneficial as it was in Bitcoin case. Above and many more ways should be collected and tested if possible. Exotic solutions aimed at structure centralization like the one by Otonomos can be considered if no other way is found. Entering real world without intermediary structures while still keeping anonymity and other DAO properties could be very beneficial. Governance TheDAO has no good tools to govern itself. There is no unified place to discuss matters concerning theDAO, no constraints and limits are applied anywhere where such discuss takes place. The best example is consider.it - 50 shades of gray. While I agree that some level of freedom is needed, for sake of efficiency and functionality certain limits and constraints should be introduced. I already wrote about it. First of all there should be a place exclusively for DAO stakeholders, it's obvious; governance discuss and voting should be constrained to limit possible solutions and unnecessary bragging; some reputation mechanism should be applied to limit frequent fruitless discuss, IDK how, to be frank; The above requires some analysis. The Wisdom of Crowd cannot be applied for simple reason of unknown competence. While prediction markets benefit from accumulating similar interests people, this is not a case of DAO. Especially when it comes to decisions regarding things foreign to many, like law for instance. Since blockchain arrived as Bitcoin I think about a social structure that would be both efficient and less biased that those around. One of main issues is always to exclude or force to learn those who exhibit obvious cognitive biases. The only solution is to test members of such system using as objective as possible measures every time they are about to take the decision. It sounds impossible but actually can be created. Investment It's really a perfect area for scammers. There are still people buying penis enlargement pills. While there is no easy way to limit people stupidity some countermeasures can be taken. It requires however some alterations to both proposal discuss solutions and voting. There should be a fixed format for proposal with mandatory fields containing most important metrics for such project. Any proposal that will not satisfy this format will be automatically rejected. Format will serve two purposes, first is to provide some factual and measurable data that can be verified, second is to accustom members with basic verification of facts and to focus their attention on them instead meaningless bla, bla that is now common. Furthermore there should be voting process alteration forcing members to answer some questions regarding the proposal if they vote yes/no. The above would be hard to accomplish but not impossible.

I found your pitch for Ethplan very interesting but I can't imagine many people outside of crypto anarchists wanting to put their trust into a system where a thief (of incredible proportions) is rewarded to a greater extent than any single other participant in the system. I understand that you believe they won't want to trust a system where balances can be reassigned or the like but was the decision truly arbitrary? It seems to me the decision was based on the trade-offs between security in the sense you propose, and a sense of security and justice that appears widely shared across most participants. If bugs are damaging property right and contractual rights (which they clearly did) more than the security damage of forks, then we should choose forks. I respect what you are trying to accomplish but I feel like your argument is potential harm vs measurable harm, and a lot of us have come to the conclusion that rectifying measurable harm by introducing some unknown amount of potential harm is the pragmatic solution to this problem especially because of the scope, reputational damage, clarity of this being a case of outright theft due to unintended code failure,  etc. I believe the power of blockchains lies not just in decentralization to achieve security but also that they incentivize cooperation. They convert self interest into a benefit to the community rather than a hindrance as often occurs in the normal economy. If we create a system which incentivizes theft above all other motives what have we accomplished? As a possible beneficiary of the DAO funding since you were proposing to it, does the thief receiving $50 million while your project receives zero funding seem like an acceptable outcome?

I would like to add that Donald's sweeping statement of Ethereum's purpose: to protect property and contractual rights immediately begs the definitional questions: What is a property right?

They come with related definitions of ""person"", ""property"" and a rich history to inform concepts such as ""intent"" and ""equity"".  Here, we do not even know where to begin.  Does a message ""signed"" by ""private key"" have any analog in meatspace ""property rights"" or ""contractual rights""?  After all, it mere suggests that a string of digits was mathematically transformed by some unknown integer.  Its presence on a blockchain infers some temporal arrangement with other messages, subject to assumptions about computing power and network connectivity.

The Ether they are awarded is their reward for ensuring the immutability of the blockchain transactions. The trust that is gained from that immutability is reflected in an increased demand, and thus price, of their Ether reward. So, I can come to only three possible conclusions as to why the upcoming forks are even possible. The miners of Ethereum don't realize the economic incentive or the impact of their actions. The miners themselves may have gambled too much of their own money/Ether in the DAO, the return of which (via forking) has a net present value higher than that of their estimated future earnings from mining. They're being paid off with an amount that has a net present value higher than that of their estimated future earnings from mining. I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

"Sitting down and finally implementing the standard token sending for MyEtherWallet was the best choice we've ever made. It wasn't necessary back in July when we started working on it, but if we hadn't, we could have never kept up with tokens these days. I know it's not as easy for exchanges, but instead of adding each token individually, it should absolutely be a subclass of ethereum with the ability to easily add new ones. This will only become more important as time goes on. Frankly, if you are an exchange and aren't planning on having the ability to refund or manually credit a customers account in situations like this, you should not be in the Ethereum space. There is another thread about CEX not having the ability to do anything with eth sent from a contract and these types of things will be harmful to people in the long run. Ethereum is all about contracts and tokens and has been since day one. Don't treat it like it is just another clone of bitcoin. In my opinion, shapeshift is one of the only ones doing right consistently. They have excellent and fast customer support and manage to fix just about any situation, even if it's manual or on their own dime. Considering most exchanges are making vastly more money than Shapeshift, they are setting the bar high and customers should support companies like theirs over those who don't care to take the time to fix situations that will doubtlessly arise again and again. edit: above was written on mobile.

"The most interesting aspect, to me, is how the argument against letting ""the attacker"" hold so much ETH has led to an outcome that basically hands a huge chunk of it to him for free, provided he played his cards right. If he predicted the soft fork would pass (endorsed it, perhaps), he could have hedged his bets by buying up DAO tokens with the profits he made from shorting ETH. If he acquires enough tokens, he's now afforded the means to ""legitimately"" acquire a very large sum of ETH (with interest)... the very outcome the fork was supposed to prevent. Plus, the whole bs about the pool votes, don't even get me started on that.

"That assumes that more miners would not have voted though. Voters often decide not to bother voting if they see it is already passing. Voting takes non-zero effort so if you believe what you want to occur is already occurring you may not bother voting. Many apparently believe that proves that voter disagreed with the vote, but we really don't know either way. A non-vote is just that, a non-vote, and could be considered equally likely to go one way or another, however since the vote was heavily in favor of one side, it could be just as easily argued that non-voting when that non-vote was going FOR the fork is considered weakly leaning towards the fork and certainly not some kind of proof they would be against it.",t3_4q43hy,fullmatches
"That's a non-argument if ever there was one. You can't argue that hypothetical at all.  The point was, they didn't vote, which is (had they been solo mining), an implicit ""no"" vote--a vote for the status quo.  That is literally the only thing you can assume about them. The fact that they can be leveraged by the pools into voting yes is what's flawed about the entire arrangement.  Forks are supposed to be difficult, not easy.

Because if the so-called ""non-voters"" were adamant in their belief / stance that a non-vote should be considered a no-vote, then why aren't we seeing them split away from the pools in droves to either solo mine and/or spin up new non-forked pools?

"You realize that a huge chunk of the miners are just the ones mining whatever happens to be the most profitable coin to mine, right? They're also the ones who either a) are immediately selling the ETH, or b) don't even see the ETH because they're doing it through a service like nicehash (which pays in BTC). The point is, without pools to leverage a small percentage of actual voters, the fork would never happen.  The fact that pools exist, and the majority of miners within the pools are non-voters, is a flawed means of achieving actual consensus among the miners.  It sidesteps the real cost of a fork: actually getting > 51% of the mining power to agree to something, by allowing a small, vocal minority to decide. Yes, the majority of miners might not care either way--but without pools that would be a vote against the fork, not a vote for it. Allowing the pools to decide has changed a non-vote from an implicit ""no"" to an implicit ""yes"". It's actually provably unfair because, by definition, a ""no"" vote is a non-vote, and a non-vote is a ""no"" vote.  They're synonymous.

"And here I was thinking I was the only one making this argument. My attempt was with numbers: the three major mining pools that own this network held ""voting"" systems that prove a minority can overtake the majority. I then tried to combat poor uptake on the argument by creating a new pool that was more idealistic, hoping to gain awareness of the issue, but the fork came too quickly for me to implement the required features (the pool is still running, however). We also shouldn't ignore that at this time our community became very hostile very quickly. The only thing we can do now is look to the future. My short term goal is to present at all the Ethereum meetups as far away as I can practically drive. Though it's unlikely I can make a dent in the current railroaded decision, we can at least keep this topic in people's hearts and minds at a time where they longer have to separate their desired outcome from the form at which we collectively make decisions. In my experience, people are having a hard time distinguishing the two. If we want salvage this for the long term, the best we can do is to show that we came to this decision -- and will come to all future decisions -- with the full weight of the network, giving legitimacy in that the decision was made with overwhelming consensus. That requires us to dismantle the pools, however, and as long a miners put financials first there's little chance that could happen. Please continue spreading this message.

"Yesterday, I wrote a statement on the  forum , articulating the same issue I had with the vote. To be clear: this has nothing to do with the DAO situation or the outcome of the vote itself. The TLDR: Pool operators can heavily influence a vote by the way they state the question, as long as there is no quorum. The thing is, in this kind of question/vote there  has  to be one default, be it yes or no. Now the fact that gets everyone itchy is that the pool operators  may  choose the default according to their own interest. The only way to mitigate this is, in my opinion, to handle such votes like a  referendum , which needs a quorum, instead of an  election , which just needs the majority. A needed quorum of maybe 33.3% can tilt the odds away from the default answer. However, this introduces a trade-off since a higher quorum means abstaining or never voting miners still steer a vote into the default direction. Although I am not really concerned with the outcome, I am, like you, concerned with the way it was achieved. However, I will recollect the vote as it went on ethermine because I think the situation regarding the democratic aspect is not as bad as it seems. As long as you were mining to their pool, you had the possibility to vote on the soft fork (pick from ""yes"", ""no"", ""don't care""). Now, /after/ the majority of voters said yes, the pool switched to the soft fork version of geth. This has two implications: 1. miners were actually voting ""no"" on the network until the vote on ethermine closed because only the geth version (or flag) in charge decides that. 2. Now miners of the pool are voting ""yes"" because it was decided by the majority,  but you are still free to stop mining for that pool now and switch to another if you do not agree with the outcome . Of course, this still does not diminish the danger of pool operators steering an apathetic horde of miners in their own favor, but here we have the core question of crypto currencies as I understand it: Do you trust majority of people behaves good or not? Even if not: there is still the incentive that miners will act such that the currency mined will be most valuable. I think this holds especially for miners with large hashrates, which was weighed into the vote, actually. Besides all the bad ways to interpret this vote, there is also this one: ""Miners did only abstain from voting because their pick, yes, was winning already"". This is why I suggest not to overestimate the lack of responsibility under the miners, and also not to generalize the DAO incident and the soft fork too much for future forks.",t3_4q43hy,cellard0or

"2- Would the community be more united if only soft forks were required? I believe a soft fork may unite people more. But the fact that it does is a bit worrisome to me. Here's 2 situations. They are no long forks. They are spoons. Spoon One would move the balance of The DAO and all Child DAOS (basically all contracts with the same hash) to a withdrawOnly() account where anyone holding tokens would then be able to withdraw the equivalent amount of ETH. Spoon Two is to block all transactions from happening from a specific contract, except for a single address. Which one of the above scares your more? At least the original version of Spoon Two was ""shut the contract down"". Now we are talking about very specifically blacklisting and whitelisting individual addresses. By the way, Spoon Two is the soft fork. Spoon One is the hard fork. Neither would turn back time. Neither would reverse any transactions. Neither would pretend stuff didn't exist. But only one starts blacklisting / whitelisting individual  people . And that scares me more than the hard fork option of ""move that sh*t to where it belongs."" Don't let your pre-conceived notion of ""hard fork is worse than soft fork"" alter your opinion of what is actually happening.

For example, ethereum had launched with the statement 'until 2020 we reserve the right to resolve/reverse what appear to be significant attacks on immature contracts which are detrimental to users or the health of the network' sort of thing, censorship may be the objectively correct approach.

"'ll give it a shot but keep in mind that I'm not a developer so the technical details may be innacurate. So starting from the beginning: The DAO, which is essentially an autonomous mutual fund created by slock.it, raises ~$200 million worth of ETH (roughly 15% of the total ETH supply). The DAO operates entirely on the blockchain and token holders vote on proposals. It's success is related to the revolutionary and experimental nature of the project. Many bugs/flaws/attack vectors are pointed out almost immediately following the release. No one identifies them as critical, so plans are made to fix them and upgrade the DAO contract. Soon after bugs are pointed out, someone manages to drain 1/3rd of the total ETH locked up in the DAO to a child-DAO (Dark-DAO) which has a ~1 month waiting period before the ETH can be withdrawn.  The entire DAO could have been drained, but when the prospect of hardfork is raised as a defense, the attacker voluntarily stops draining the funds to avoid further antagonizing the community. Not long after that the ""Robinhood Group"" infiltrates the Dark DAO and also drains the remaining ETH into another child-DAO (""whitehat DAO). Unfortunately, all funds are going to be locked in a futile stalemate with endless back and forth attacks so that no productive use can ever be made with the funds and a constant source of distraction and wasted effort will ensue. Community vigorously debates whether to rescue the funds via a risky hardfork, a risky soft fork, or to do no fork. Each approach had its pros and cons.  A soft fork is attempted, but it turns out that Ethereum is inherently censorship resistant and the soft fork is unsuccessful.  A hard fork becomes only option to return the funds to the original investors and avoid lawsuits and endless back and forth attacks. So after vigorous debate, multiple votes are performed that all show a large majority supporting the decision to hard fork.  Many acknowledge that Ethereum is very early in development, that all blockchains are controlled by people and the use of hardfork to correct crimes against large segments of the community is an inherent part of the social contract on which blockchains exist. Furthermore, since the hacked funds are locked in a child DAO, a hard fork is a simple solution and no other transactions need to be reversed to correct the theft. Many criticize this decision because of the small percentage of coins/miners that voted on the issue but as is now apparent the outcomes of those votes were a valid measure of the community sentiment since the current ratio of ETC/ETH mining (15%) is nearly identical to results of the votes.. Ethereum goes ahead and forks but some people (10-20%) stick with the original non-forked chain (Ethereum Classic AKA ETC) mostly because they they believe that abstract concepts about blockchains are more important than concepts of justice, pragmatism, and stopping crimes. Many people against the fork also believe the blockchain is not the proper place for arbitration and criminals should be dealt with via the traditional legal system, but they also recognized that there is no legal recourse to recover the stolen funds. Ethereum developers achieve a stunning success with the hard fork as there are no glitches and all ETH invested in the DAO is returned to its rightful owners, reversing a large crime and preventing endless lawsuits. However, Some investors see a profit opportunity and exchanges list ETC for trading.  The price is very volatile and speculative.   Almost all ETH developers and users wish ETC success but see it as a new project and announce that they are going to stay with the project that they have always been working on The Whitehat DAO continues their voluntary quest to retrieve the stolen ETC for DAO investors, which now have value based on the ETC speculation.  They appear to make some mistakes and lack some expertise for how to resolve a very complicated problem of returning the ETC.  However, most members of the community acknowledge their skill and effort and realize that they would have received nothing if not for their work.  A lot of ETC people criticize them but do nothing themselves to help solve the problem.",t3_4xefob,latetot

"Short and simple (as possible) On Day 1 there was ETH. And it was good On Day 2 there was the DAO smart contract. We could send it our ETH and it would record us as having DAO tokens. We could always trade our DAO tokens back for ETH if we wanted to. This worked through a slightly complex system of creating a child DAO. While complex, overall we thought that the DAO was good. On Day 3 a hacker found a way to take more ETH out of the DAO smart contract then he had put in. He didn't take it all, but he took a whole lot. This by most accounts was bad. On Day 4 a group of people got together and drained the remainder of the ETH from the faulty DAO, the same way the hacker did, in an attempt to protect the funds. This was considered good by many in a time of great uncertainty but as our trust was broken many are also weary. At the very least, THESE people announced what they were doing. On Day 5, after a long decision of what to do and a failed soft fork, the developers working on the Ethereum platform decided to create a hard fork. This would essentially give people the option to return all the ETH stolen into a new contract where everyone could go and withdraw their funds. This decision seemed to be supported by a majority with a very substantial and vocal minority disagreeing with this decision. On day 6 the Ethereum developers released the new code that would create a hard fork and recover all the funds. Much of the community downloaded the new software and elected to run the hard fork. This made many of us happy and the price of ETH started to rise again. However, this did not make everyone happy. Many many people were not happy. So unhappy, that they refused to run the hard fork code. Instead, they continued running the old code. Now we had a single blockchain genesis block with two diverging ends. As a way for people to know which end of the fork people were supporting, the community continued to call the forked branch where the DAO funds were recovered ETH and started calling the branch where the coins were not recovered ETC. There is no consensus on if this was good or bad. Though everyone one agrees at least that part of this is bad. On day 7, when we all should have rested, exchanges began to list ETC, suddenly giving it an exchange rate and value. This created a quagmire since everyone that had ETH pre-fork now has ETH and ETC since they share history up until that point. And since the underlying protocol is identical, if you create a transaction on one network then you also create a transaction on the other. This could cause many unintended consequences.  People now had to figure out a way to ""split"" their tokens. This means taking your ETH and ETC coins that exist at the same address on two blockchains and moving them to separate addresses on two blockchains. This is widely regarded as super annoying and unfortunately complicated. On day 8 we realized that we are not all powerful and we couldn't settle a relatively simple distributed smart contract platform that is the future of the world when God is said the have made everything in like 6 days. On day 9 shit hit the fan as ETC value started rising and ETH dropping. There seemed to be so much FUD in the community and bad actors involved that the whole story at this point diverges we have no idea what was going on.   ETC was gaining more popularity and seemed to be developing its own community. Bitfinix, a coin exchange, gets hacked, ETC starts to pump in value, no one knows what the hell is going on. This was a dark day in crypto. On day 10, pretty much every substantial actor in the continuing Ethereum community placed support behind ETH and this went a long way to calming the fires that were springing up on day 9. On day 11, things stabilized a bit in the ETH community but we are still far and away from being able to rest. The attacker and the white hackers were able to move their coins but this was excepted and create little turbulence in the community, potentially since there has been lots happening in the BTC community. We still have a lot of work to do and let's hope that day 12 is a hard fork to happier times. Note: I know I missed a lot of finer details.

Not long after that a second hacker (or so we believe) who called the ""Robinhood Group"" drains the remaining ETH into another child-DAO (""whitehat DAO). Ethereum foundation member(s) donate funds to and claim to be working with the Robinhood Group. Community vigorous debates whether to rescue the funds via a risky hardfork, a risky soft fork, or to do no fork and have the ""Robinhoods"" steal back the ETH and return it to original owners. Each approach had its pros and cons. So after vigorous debate and all sorts of political bullshittery the Ethereum foundation decides to go with the fork. Many criticize this decision because of the tiny percentage of coins/miners that voted on the issue and there was nowhere near unanimity among the few that did manage to vote. Ethereum goes ahead and forks but many people (10-20%) stick with the original non-forked chain (Ethereum Classic AKA ETC) mostly because of the belief that upholding the fundamental principles is more important that bailing out irresponsible investors. Many people against the fork also believe the blockchain is not the proper place for arbitration and criminals should be dealt with via the traditional legal system. Ethereum foundation urges exchanges to ignore ETC which leads to the losses of millions of dollars worth of ETC due to what is known as the replay attack (most notably from BTC-E). Poloniex is the first exchange to list ETC and the price skyrockets. Several days pass and ETC begins gaining market share while ETH (forked chain) is dropping in value fast. Vitalik makes a post on reddit in an attempt to stop the mass dumping of the chain he and the foundation declared the one true Ethereum. Vitalik declares that he will not support ETC even if the majority does. Many other developers make a similar pledge if allegiance which creates a further divide between the two communities. It's been a few weeks after the fork and suddenly the coins in the ""whitehat"" DAO are sent to an unknown address. Someone claiming to be a part of the Robinhood Group assures everyone that the good guys are in control of the 7 million ETC (worth ~$15 million at the time). Not long after that, someone notices that the ""Robinhoods"" sent 3 million ETC to exchanges and began dumping it for other cryptocurrencies. People begin to panic/question. Ethereum Foundation member who originally announced the Foundations cooperation with the Robinhood Group now claims the Foundation has nothing to do with them. Exchanges freeze funds after its become apparent that the hacker is dumping stolen coins. Hacker makes post on reddit assuring he's with the good guys and begs the exchanges to return to coins he stole and pinky promises to return the ETC back to the rightful owners this time. Hacker says he will send the coins to a ""trusted"" cryptocurrency exchange that is coincidentally partnered with slock.it (the amateur/fraudulent coders responsible for this whole mess) to be redistributed to the rightful owners.",t3_4xefob,jkgy
"Deprecated chain (ETC) had less than 20GH/s of hash power 24h after the fork - which is only 0.5% of main chain hash. 96h later, Poloniex  does the unthinkable - adds ETC to exchange even though a 51% attack could be performed by a medium sized miner farm.

The reason the hashrate was so low is because mining was not viable on that chain until there was an avenue for miners to dump their coins, as well as the fact that the Ethereum Foundation worked hard to convince everyone that the chain would be worthless. As soon as Poloniex listed ETC the free market decided it was worth ~5-10% the value of ETH and the hashrate grew to match. It was Poloniex who gave life to ETC, not the community. People moved to ETC looking for fast profit. Poloniex added an asset to their exchange that people wanted to trade. They did so because trading fees is how they make money.",t3_4xefob,jkgy

We get a deadlock because contract A's mutex is already locked. This could be resolved with an exception. One way to ensure that deadlocks are avoided is to always take locks in the same order.

"The core question for me is this one. Why should a big corporation/entity put trust in ethereum? They will put trust in ethereum if they observe that the  promised  rules get obeyed under any circumstances, no matter how much money/pressure some other entity puts into the system. The system must resist to change the rules in any case. That's the main selling point for ethereum and blockchains in gerneral. Being fully trustless and immutable. My fear is that the whole fork discussion already has damaged the long term perspective of any  public  blockchain, ethereum included. Blockchains are only useful if they are transparent AND immuntable. If we fork for political/ethical/non-technical reasons, we are damaging the fundament of blockchains in general.",t3_4r8cqj,gergi
"No big institutional entity will take ethereum serious if we as the community change the rules after they got deployed. Yes. Exactly.  Vitalik designed Ethereum to be very resistant to such things, but sadly the DAO happened early enough and was big enough that the fork (attack) is now possible. Soon Ethereum will be too big and consensus too distributed for this sort of fork (attack) to be successful. If we fork for political/ethical reasons, we are damaging the fundament of blockchains in general. I hope this isn't true.  I do have confidence that the community will route around this (political fork) vulnerability and become truly resistant to tampering.  The intended use-case of a fork is a clear VM bug which undermines the system for everyone.  In this case we have a consolidation of power and a destructive level of influence of a small number of vocal parties. I think it depends a bit on how crucial the core team ends up being to the larger scale distributed success of a cryptocurrency platform.  Obviously in the early stage, the intellect (Vitalik) and momentum by the early team is a big factor in adoption, but with success they can be relatively obsolete to the ongoing improvement of the ecosystem (as evidenced by Satoshi's absence).",t3_4r8cqj,umami99
"Actually it's not as dire as all that. In any crypto, you can always refuse to change. The only catch is that if the miners disagree, they may interfere with you. That means ultimately you might have to change the PoW algorithm, which entails friction but is perfectly doable in a pinch. Since Ethereum is young, a hard fork now would ""merely"" set it back a year or two, after which if it survives the competition (especially a copycat that has ""truly unstoppable contracts"") it could thrive. However, the truly nimble way to deal with this hard fork issue is to retain the unforked version and get the cryptocurrency exchanges to allow both versions to be traded independently. Then investors who want an actual adult platform will use the unforked version, and its price will soon rise to reflect that, while the Care Bear version will be repriced appropriately, presumably to zero (but I leave that for the market to decide).",t3_4r8cqj,Noosterdam
"Of course, downvotes.  Sadly. The TL;DR is that just because a fork is possible, and the end result might be ""just"" doesn't mean it is right. Reaching back into the blockchain to modify a contract is interference in contract. It is no more legal, ethical or technically elegant than running a contract through a shredder, printing a new version, forging everyone's signature, and replacing at least 51% of the copies with the new version. Even if technology allows. Interference with contract ""might be"" (i am not a lawyer, this is my opinion) a crime in many jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, i understand even planning to commit a crime with others is a criminal conspiracy, and anyone advocating for the crime is guilty of an offence. Perhaps let that sink in. I don't know how much more compelling an argument this community needs to hear, but I'm on record against the hard fork as contemplated. I'm also on record recommending everyone involved to think carefully about what they say, what they write and what they do. I think ethereum community should be looking at ways to recover from this mess. But I think these also need to be  LEGAL  ways to recover from this mess.",t3_4r8cqj,jps_

"Human actors decide I've seen this point made a few times.  It's both true and completely beside the point, and your suggestion (taken literally) is a red herring. Suggesting that the mutability of the blockchain is the intended goal is neither strictly true or strictly false. The  goal  as I see it is decentralized consensus that is immune from the corruption that comes with consolidation of power, hence the great efforts made in the design of the system to make consolidated power  difficult .  This is why the soft fork is proving to be technically difficult to implement. Like with human government systems, the words ""democracy"" and ""majority"" are both subject to a variety of definitions.  Various definitions have consequences in the sort of system you end up with... and usually present tradeoffs in the tendency of the system to change vs resist change. The status quo always benefits one group, and change always benefits another group.  Similarly, defining a majority as >50% benefits one group, while defining it as >60% benefits another, and >80% another still. Similarly, plurality voting schemes have (in a particular context) a set of beneficiaries.   This sort of distributional reality is why Marxist social theorists are cynical about the treasured institutions of democracy.  They feel that ultimately the rules end up benefitting the holders of power.  We're seeing this happen now where the holders of power (lots of Ether) who invested in the DAO are trying to rejigger the system to act favorably toward their interests.  This is classic corruption, it just doesn't seem that way yet because there are a lot of nice and reasonable people who are advocating the fork. Even nice people become corrupt or support corrupt systems.  In the US we are taught to view other nations with potentially inferior or less mature democratic institutions as somehow less enlightened, but in reality it is often the case that reasonable people unwittingly support the forces that lead to corruption, little by little, until it's too late and the system is irrevocably corrupt. The rules dictate the sorts of issues where there is not universal consent or dissent, and frame the sort of issues where there can potentially be change. The system will be what it is based on the rules... the danger lies in changing the rules after the fact, and creating an unpredictable landscape for risk-taking. Risk sharing, hedging, and arbitrage are the essence of financial markets, so introducing additional systemic risk (of things like a politically motivated fork that is not a VM bug) changes the characteristics of the system to make it less useful for financial matters.",t3_4r8cqj,umami99
"This is equivalent to catching a bank robber Not at all. The smart contract behaved as coded, and that should be all we consider when determining the ""morality"" of someone's interaction with that contract. I can't believe that anyone is arguing for the undermining of the meaning of  code  in a contract.  Doing so is such a slippery slope, and presents a huge vulnerability surface area for attackers to claim intent.  Who gets to judge intent?  If I hastily skim some code and send money to a smart contract because I  thought  it did something, can I ask to have it reversed? If someone writes a contract and calls it by a name that implies it behaves a certain way, but its code actually behaves differently and I get scammed by it, can I ask to have it reversed? What about a highly complex scenario where there are multiple oracles involved and potentially subtle timing-related logic in the contract?  What does ""intent"" even mean in that scenario?  The only way to truly understand a complex contract is to read and understand the code. If you cannot do that, you need to trust someone else's judgement. The person you trust should have earned that trust by proving he/she is good at it.  None of this happened with the DAO.

However, the bigger mistake (in my opinion) was not having any sort of insurance contract available to let participants mitigate the risk that the contract would not behave as expected. Assuming there was demand for both sides of the risk (which I think there was), an insurance contract could have been created by anyone, and profit could have been made regardless of the outcome. It is interesting that much of the visionary zeal animating the Ethereum community seems to relate more to the lesson many learned from Bitcoin, which is ""get in early and go big"".  As any con artist knows, the best way to get humans to make foolish decisions is to appeal to their basic greed.

"I think it says a lot about our community that we can have opposing views AND have a meaningful discussion. The first is plentiful. The latter scarce. Having said that, I've changed from anti fork to pro fork. Here's why: Blockchains are about consensus. Mostly automated and digital, sometimes manual. Manual in extreme cases, like we're currently experiencing. Or when a better version of the code is introduced in order to help with scale, speed, security to name a few. Consensus is driven by economical incentives. In the current situation there is an economic incentive for manual consensus to fork, because: 1 an individual with 3,4mln eth has too much influence (with staking in mind), posing a threat to long term viability of ethereum. 2 people outside eth will gain trust when they see the community resolving theft in a never before seen way. (Have you ever heard of institutions/individuals  getting money back after something like the swift hacks?) this will really be a selling point to current outsiders. 3 eth lost in the hack is uncertain to be invested back into the ecosystem. Having it returned increases the chance it will be used in a constructive manner. Now I understand that forking should be precise and definitely not rushed. But bear in mind we've forked before. Last March from frontier to homestead. And have planned to have at least four more: metropolis, serenity and ethereum 2.0 ... 3.0 ... As strong core members I can understand an ideologically driven approach to what we see as the core of blockchain: immutability and trust. However we should not see these as the most important factors, over consensus. Consensus is it the very core what blockchains are about. The technology helps us to automate it and thus trust each other. And every once in a while, we have to solve something the tech can't yet automate. For instance when we have to manually reach consensus on changing the code. And the system allows for this.

Also, you have fallen for the Bogeyman lie, which is that a bad guy, with a minority of eth, can wreak havoc. Firstly, head back to that consensus thing and read up on it.  Second, if we don't fork, the devs are on record that the hacker can be counter-hacked.  So the real outcome of this (if not fixed) isn't that 15% of eth falls into the hands of a bad guy... It's that 15% can't fall into anybody's hands.  So stake this ether to a mining pool and presto... Curated PoS. Third, lets pretend 3.7 M eth can wreak havoc in the hands of a miscreant. If so, then look out below, because that means 40 M$ can affect 1B$, in which case some hedge fund could clean up by shorting the snot out of eth, use the proceeds to buy a 4%stake, and wreak havoc.

I'd personally decline to invest in both. But just as Madoff's shenanigans did not require a reboot of the mainstream financial system, the DAO does not require any change to Ethereum.  Mistakes were made, people suffered, people learned. Let's move on. Imagine a new DAO with highly vetted security and insurance smart contracts available to hedge against various risks.  This would be truly awesome, and I'd buy Ether to invest in it. The DAO was a great beta, but not ready for production.  Ethereum is already in production, so let's just move on.",t3_4r8cqj,umami99

"Hey! Welcome to the community - I'll try and answer all the questions I know the answer too, but hopefully other people hop in and help out where there are holes in my knowledge. First of all, the DAO hack was very different than the empty accounts attack. The  DAO  was a smart contract written on top of the Ethereum blockchain by  Slock.it . It was not a part of the Ethereum protocol itself. So yes, if the code written on the blockchain has bugs in it, it is easy to attack (but this is no different than the  internet today ). However, the empty accounts attack was a legitimate attack on the Ethereum protocol itself. A DOS attacker took advantage of a couple mispriced OP-codes to increase the size of the state of the Ethereum blockchain for much cheaper than they should have been able to. But these issues have since been fixed with a protocol upgrade (hard-fork). There is no denying that Ethereum has a larger interface to the world than Bitcoin does, but I don't think that necessarily means it has a larger attack surface; IMO, Ethereum has a large surface area, but a very opaque one. I read a quote somewhere that said something to the effect of ""at some point, a DOS on the Ethereum network attack will be indistinguishable from regular transactions."" I also think that many Bitcoin maximalists are critical of Ethereum for two reasons. The first is that they feel threatened by it, and the second is it breaks a lot of the rules they think should exist in the space. The threat portion of this critical attitude is something that exists with most cryptocurrencies. It existed when Ethereum was created and when Monereo was created and when Z-Cash was created - people who are heavily invested in a cryptocurrency have no motivation to support a new currency and every motivation to hate it. The second part of this criticism is that many Bitcoin maximalists feel Ethereum ""breaks the rules."" Many people have been involved with Bitcoin since the early years and maintain some level of reverence to Satoshi and Bitcoin's innovations (it's worth noting there is also some amount of dev worship present in the Ethereum community - but in this case, it does not halt innovation, IMO it helps support innovation). This mindset and reverence to the original ideas make Ethereum's new directions understandably uncomfortable to some. I would argue no. As I said before, there is a difference between having a large surface area and a large attack surface. On top of that, as illustrated by the recent hard-forks to fix the aforementioned mispriced OP-codes, Ethereum is constantly decreasing its attack surface area. As compared to Bitcoin, the Ethereum community seems to be devoted to protocol improvement (see  Casper ). Transparency, good practices, and good communication. The key to any good cryptosystem is open-source code that follows well-defined security practices. Of course, there will probably be some more issues before the platform reaches maturity, but the community has shown it is willing to adapt and recover quickly, and I think that is the most valuable trait of any crypto-community.",t3_5p9mmr,naterush1997

"The answer is simple as greed, fear and lazyness. Btc maximalist have everything to lose in ETH success. So they will try to find anything to make people believe it's a weak technology. Meanwhile, as they broadcast each new argument of a possible ETH weakness, this breach is taken in account by someone in the Ethereum community, thus making ETH more stronger every day, thanks to ETH haters. Btc maximalists have invested too much in something that was a giant step in trust and money history. I will be eternally grateful for what they discover then years ago. But building over giants shoulders is the way progress works. ETH learned from btc. ETH is young and even still a baby. Also just remember that we have to be aware and if something better than Ethereum arrives, we should not act as btc maximalists. For the facts that ETH is an unlimited attack field, this this is true. It's much more complex than btc and only a system without smart contracts won't have smart contracts flaws...

It isn't an infinite attack surface. Just larger than bitcoin due to increased complexity of the EVM. It isn't turing complete due to fees and in the long run it will shine very brightly indeed.

Agreed. But internet is pretty much unlimited and it is not supposed to be immutable. WE can upgrade the protocol whenever we need and make sure that we dont get spammed by DDOS.

Maybe there are political reasons for wasting a lot of money on an attack. I don't have any answer to that, which is probably a common vulnerability in all permissionless blockchains. The miners would be very happy for this as they would get a lot of income. From their point of view, everything is fine. But the users would not be happy, which is of course the important thing.",t3_5p9mmr,LarsPensjo

There is no difference to develop for ETH vs ETC - but DAPPs can only run on one chain at a time. It is very complicated to have two instances of a dapp running at the same time on separate ledgers - and so it is not just copying and pasting if the goal is to run on both chains. Ultimate dapps will go where users are.  Right now most main stream ETH users are on the ETH chain. If that changes over time the two chains may end up catering to different markets.it is not a zero sum game. They both can prosper.,t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"Is it ""very complicated to have two instances of a dapp running at the same time on separate ledgers"" because of the replay attacks? It seems like another HF would be needed to separate the chains and prevent replays. Once this happens, I am not quite sure I understand why it would be complicated to have two apps running at the same time on both chains. Isn't a smart contract essentially just a software program? Why exactly wouldn't users be able to choose which chain to run the Dapp on if they have separate or both clients? I did read  here , that it looks like devs can prevent their Dapp from running on the other chain, but I am not sure why someone couldn't copy the source code to run on ETC. Obviously it requires maintenance and updates, which I don't believe ETC has, otherwise they would HF to prevent replays instead of requesting Vitalik to do it for them. but in theory, it seems relatively easy to switch if that is what the userbase decides. I do believe that the two chains will coexist (hopefully peacefully) and cater to their separate markets, but I am disappointed that ETH will lose out on some of the ""exponential"" gains from synergy effects as noted in Rune's synergy  post . For example, I used the Daemon darknet market, which could drive more users into Ethereum-but on the ETC chain. If that grows faster than ETH developments, I fear ETH developers will ""go where the users are"" and ETC may win over ETH.",t3_4vlw2o,sorryjustsaying
No it has nothing to do with replay attacks. The problem is that you fracture the operation of your dapp by running it on two separate ledgers. For example Augur would have to have two separate markets for its prediction markets but this makes those markets less effective. Augur has a strong incentive to make users come to a single chain for betting.  Many dapps have an incentive to avoid fracturing their operations and have users come To a single chain.,t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"ok, this makes a lot of sense. I was thinking in terms of self contained Dapps that can be left alone and running without maintenance. Augur, Digix and others (Dapps with real world utility) require outside blockchain development/maintenance. These would have to choose which chain they support. It is good to know  most  of the useful Dapps will support ETH. For apps that run solely within their respective blockchain, or Dapp contract, is this still the case? For example the ZK-snark anonymizing contract, or a dice app that calculates using a future block hash. Does anyone know if Daemon's marketplace is self contained within its Dapp? Are these easily copiable to the other blockchain? It sounds like the answer is yes, but without the synergy of the ecosystem Rune noted, it won't get very far. Thank you for your contribution!",t3_4vlw2o,sorryjustsaying
"I think it's fair to say that some contracts whose utility does not depend on users interacting with eachother can be copied between ETC and ETH (and also with counterparty, rootstock). But the more important issue is dapps that require user interactions. These are the ones that can fuel mainstream adoption and these have a strong incentive to operate on a single ledger.",t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"I'm the creator of the Truffle development environment. It's always been a goal to support deploying to multiple chains. In our original use case this consisted of the test net and the live net; but the same technology makes it just as easy to manage the same Dapp on both ETC and ETH. I've even heard reports it can deploy to Rootstalk as well. If you use Truffle, management is much less complicated.",t3_4vlw2o,therealtimcoulter
"Right - but that doesn't mean that dapps built on truffle do not have a strong incentive to operate on a single ledger.  Of course, you can develop/deploy on any chain you want but that doesn't make the chains interoperable.",t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"Definitely depends on the Dapp. Dapps built with Truffle will automatically detect the network the user is using and use the correct contracts accordingly. This requires developers to deploy only a single version of their Dapp (assuming they've deployed the dapps contracts to both chains). A Reddit style Dapp, for instance, could exist on both chains without issue and with little effort on the side of the developer. A token Dapp, however, may have to exist solely on one chain as it otherwise confuses their store of value.",t3_4vlw2o,therealtimcoulter
Correct but most of the large dapps use tokens. Even Akasha (only Reddit style dapp announced)  sounds like they will use a token.,t3_4vlw2o,latetot
I still don't quite get why the copy paste doesn't work. Isn't it similar to having Xbox gamers playing on their own servers against themselves with PC gamers sandboxed on their own platform too.,t3_4vlw2o,cypher437
"Right but Dapps depend on users interacting with each other much more than video games do. If you run two separate instances of a Dapp, the users can't communicate, trade, interact with each other. Dapps have a huge incentive to get all users on a single chain.",t3_4vlw2o,latetot
Hmm it sounds like its going to be another one of those decade long fights like the Google vs Apple vs Microsoft where they all wall off their services from each other.,t3_4vlw2o,cypher437
I think the incentives are different. Its not an artificial separation - it's just that dapps work better the more users they have and this requires them to be on a single chain.,t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"If it was 50/50 today, then perhaps. But right now, exchages aside, all the dapps are running on ETH. It will be more like BTC vs LTC. LTC kinda pointlessly existing, with little services running on it, because why would anyone do it, if there's BTC?",t3_4vlw2o,DoUHearThePeopleSing
"To most users the dapps don't add a huge value, it's still in Beta so there is plenty of time for that killer app to come up on either chain and dominate.",t3_4vlw2o,cypher437
"It's kind of like supporting two speaking languages within one app. It's easy to have just one language - doesn't matter which one. You can also copy the app's code and rewrite all the messages. But if you want to have multiple languages within one app, you'll have to deal with extra complexity everywhere. You can't just write: ""show message 'x'"", you have to write ""show message '(language[x])', and then handle tiny differences between languages. But once you deal with that all, it's easy do add third, fourth and fifth languages. That's why exchanges did implement ETC - they already handle a ton of currencies, so for them the code is there. And that's why Digix et al mostly won't. Yeah, it's doable, yeah it's not crazy amount of work, but they simply have more pressing issues at hand. Finally, let's not forget that it's money. A devastating bug can be in every tiny place. Even a smaller feature can have problems. You forget to split currencies somewhere, or you mix indexes and send ETC instead of ETH, and your business is gone. If you're still not convinced, imagine how many little things have to change on a website for it to process two currencies instead of one. You need an extra selector on every page to allow choosing currency, you need two addresses for two chains, and so on. Just browse any dapp like digix, and look at all the spots that would now have to be modified if you wanted to support both currencies. Not to mention that you need to maintain connection to two blockchains, and that you need to somehow manage risk of a potential attack on ETC due to a low hashrate ( even if the community is peaceful, these things happen - look at feathercoin:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1g0yvf/feathercoin_going_through_a_real_51_attack_people/  ).",t3_4vlw2o,DoUHearThePeopleSing
"This. Right now the ecosystem is young. If we look around at mature platform ecosystems (such as IOS vs Android / PC vs MAC) we see that there are instances of differentiation by platform, and other instances of ubiquity across platform.  Ultimately, it comes down to each DAPP, and whether or not there is sufficient marginal market opportunity to justify the effort of supporting more than one platform. In the case of ETC and ETH, the two platforms are functionally identical, which makes supporting two platforms trivially easy.  The question depends on whether or not there is a sufficient incremental market to justify the effort. Jury's out on that one. [e:  example]",t3_4vlw2o,jps_
"I think this is different than an app trying to decided whether or not to be supported on iOS and android and PC ect because being supported on these opens up a much larger user base for the app. I don't think running a dapp on both ETH and ETC will bring a larger user base at all, since there will still only be one front end of the dapp with the block chain working in the background.",t3_4vlw2o,Wegie
"That might be true, but there are a lot of new ETC holders who probably don't hold ETH, and a lot of ETH holders who no longer hold ETC.  So there is usefulness to reach additional people. Also, there is a cost difference to running DAPPs on ETC versus ETH, because the price of Gas is the same in Wei, but different in dollars (lower on the lower priced chain).  So there are more profits to be had by running on the cheaper chain. Finally, if an app is useful, it will create competition.  The easiest way for competition to differentiate is to support the ""other"" community.  It's probably a horrible idea to allow your competition to deliver an identical service with a cheaper cost position, because then then have a profit advantage.",t3_4vlw2o,jps_
"Well put. People tend to wave the Digix and Maker card, but there is no way they will stubbornly stick to ETH over ETC if it compromises their goals and business model.",t3_4vlw2o,antiprosynthesis
"isn't anything developed for the ETH hf chain also compatible with ETC? At the moment, yes. What is preventing ETC from copy pasting Dapps developed for ETH onto their chain and vice versa? Nothing, but it ain't that easy... A Dapp is so much more than code, it's community and ecosystem. If most people have Mist running on top of ETH, your dapp on ETC won't reach them.  If your Dapp uses tokens, then it will only be able to use the tokens available on that chain - so if you want to bet or participate in a prediction market, then no Digix of Maker stablecoin for you to express your bet in. The advantage of one network over the other  is even stronger for anything that requires network effect to function, such as any market, social network (obviously), in general most things that involve interactions between users. I recommend reading this kind-of-famous ""Synergy"" - post by  /u/rune4444 : https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/43fm3w/the_core_value_proposition_of_ethereum_is_synergy/",t3_4vlw2o,cryptopascal
"I loved Rune's synergy post and it was one of the concepts that convinced me to participate and invest in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, now I feel like some of that synergy has been fractured by the HF split. If Maker (anti-fork  prior  to the Digix joint announcement) was, and  still might be , considering a switch, that really made me question the solidity of the community's decision. What if others feel the same way and decide to follow or migrate to ETC? ETH will lose some of that synergy, and the ""exponential"" gains from network effects that Rune noted in his post. I don't believe the ETH community will HF as easily again, but a more ""immutable"" blockchain does make sense for some applications after all.",t3_4vlw2o,sorryjustsaying
"No his post is still applicable.  There are no critical dapps that are running only on the ETC chain. Dapps have a strong incentive to remain converged on a shared ledger. Right now that is ETH.  No one can guarantee that they would not all switch over to ETC but unless there is clear evidence of more users on the ETC chain (not just speculators), it seems unlikely for that shift to occur.",t3_4vlw2o,latetot
"Dapps can be dependent on the current state of the chain. For example if libraries and dependencies are built on ETH, you couldn't just copy the source of one DAPP without copying all its dependencies. If one dapp interacts with an older DAPP, specifically the state of an older DAPP (very loose example - a DAPP that uses the amount of ETH left in the withdraw DAO address to do some calculation) it wouldn't work on another chain. In this case its obvious that just copying this source code will not give the intended function in the ETC chain because of the different states of the chain.",t3_4vlw2o,_Age_

"Short term ETC is a mess because of replay's ETH and ETC are in the same boat here. ETH will probably need to do another HF to solve it. Long term ETC is also a mess because it can't switch to PoS Who says ETC can't switch to PoS?

"The thing is that there is much more network effect already locked in on ETH, you can even see a thread about it on this frontpage.

"This is a great point, and I think the network effects of keeping Dapps ""clean"" on ETH will attract/keep the most/best developers. While I do think darknet markets will attract the most hardcore of crypto anarchists, growing the ecosystem, and keeping the coexisting ETC chain alive, legitimate Dapps (especially with existing corporate and Financial Institution support) will hopefully prefer to remain on the ETH chain. FI's probably won't touch ETC if it hosts darknet markets, preserving ETH's synergy. I don't want to lock you into a decision, but would you remain on ETH even if ETC outgrows ETH in the short term? Would it even be possible have Maker running on both? If the tide does begin to turn, favoring ETC, does Maker have a position regarding sharing a blockchain with illegal Dapps? say if the DAI stablecoin is used as currency in the darknet markets, would this pose risks to the Maker organization? Again, this is assuming ETC overtakes ETH for whatever reason, whether ETH users switch or ETC attracts a majority of the BTC community. (which now looks like they might have their own  split ).

"With every feature that ETC developers will add to ETC the code-base will diverge away from ETH. That will increase the time and efforts to merge the changes from Ethereum foundation ETH git repository to ETC git repository. The more they will diverge, the more effort it will take to keep up.

Just run 2 nodes instead of 1. All you do is pair or group contracts as needed and put it all together on your server. You would just have to reflect distinct availability in one or the other.

"How does the application registry function given that it's decentralised and anyone can claim anything? Community approval or rating of transaction model; I'd like to know more about this. Together, the application registry and transaction framework mitigates Sybil and whitewashing attacks by providing an incentive to participate, introducing an economic and computational cost to participation, and providing a metric for reputation in order to maintain optimal connectivity. This is tricky stuff but I guess some of the work has been done here? The token feels a little forced in but it's probably workable since you're building a lot of software so it's non trivial for someone to clone and just avoid the fee (I assume?). Suppliers will price in fiat and just need to manage tokens somewhat. It isn't based around a scarce resource but is being used to bootstrap a community which I think is fair game. I applaud removing the transaction fee for all the reasons you've stated. Anything other than a microtransaction isn't sustainable in this type of model. There's a lot of technology to build yet and the economics of the entire system are a great big unknown, however if people believe this is the way forwards then they'll take that risk. The upside is huge and the project appears to be on a sound footing. I haven't looked at what's being built or researched the team in depth but the information is out there for anyone considering the project. Another plus is the longevity. They've priced in 4 years and included some more tokens which can provide a big chunk of 'second round' funding if they keep the project moving. Although, I think 6 months is too short and I'm unclear quite why this is a technical issue related to upgrading tokens? A minimum of 3 years is important to target because of how much the technology will change in that time. Ethereum is nowhere near ready for prime time usage yet and the whitepaper is explicit about the immaturity of a bunch of related technologies. If I write ten points about this, I haven't decided what they are yet... In general I'm very positive about how this has been put forwards and iterated. If there's something missing it's some third party credibility checks because I'm not qualified to comment on the feasibility and existing work. On the assumption that the work is ok and team is as good as it looks then this is a great project. One that may not work but one could say the same about Ethereum.",t3_58ndzx,newretro

Application Registry is an Ethereum smart contract. Anyone can certify anything, but most users won't like to run applications certified by anonymous. They will choose application created and certified by well-known individuals and organisations. Community approval or rating of transaction model; It’s a similar idea as above. Fair, useful transaction models will be certified more often. Additionally, if current transaction model is certified by well-known entities and the users inform developers that it’s useful it may be added to default whitelist.

Maybe some more analysis of needs so that the value proposition of Golem vs cloud services or commertial render farms is clearer. What are golem's strengths and weaknesses vs existing products. Are they sufficient advantages to overcome barriers. How will you convince companies? Will you have a B2B sales force? The economic model for the GNT is not really clear. I understand that it may not be possible to supply a detailed argument without risking promoting a security. However some kind of economic argument about why the price of GNT will increase as use of the network grows would be appreciated. Draw some kind of diagram of the expected flow, lockup and uses of GNT. (How does the amount required or locked up change as usage grows?) How will customers buy GNT? / How will providers sell their GNT? (will you develop an exchange?) How will providers price in Eth, stable coins or fiat? Will they need to keep adjusting prices using an oracle? Rationally most providers should probably want to sell GNT to fund electricity and server management (especially in the long term as profit margins fall).

"Market stratergy section still feels a bit weak. If you look at the last 10-20 years’ of progress in virtualization, it’s obvious that setting up any kind of environment in a datacenter or on an individual computer has become much easier. But when it comes to actually renting the hardware, it still tends still to be painful: comparing the offerings of different providers is complicated, and it takes quite a bit of time and expertise to figure out the best solution for a given task. Then of course, deploying the task also needs some technical proficiency. This is likely due to the huge asymmetry of information in what is effectively an oligopolistic market. What we are aiming to - creation of highly competitive market - should be interested for everyone but major player. Of course we will be doing a lot of BDM/B2B, although we want to focus on software developers/software companies mostly. The economic model for the GNT is not really clear. The most important feature of GNT is that it is used for transactions and its supply is fixed. You are right that there are limitations related to that (market volatility, ease of obtaining some, etc) but that is true for any token. I believe that all the development we are witnessing now in Ethereum will increase general UX. As for details, we want at some point to allow user to set prices in fiat, with corresponding GNT prices adjusting based on an external source of data (still to be discussed how to do that in secure way). Long term, I would like to see wide implementation of stable coins to hold value in users wallets and GNT being used with conversion at spot price for transfer.",t3_58ndzx,julian_z

Fair point. Indeed DAO seems the socialistic movement of the markets. Probably it works in specific cases.,t3_6jelnp,lbalan79

While some argued that one could just depend on those whales making economically rational decisions, it somewhat contradicts the broader concept of a DAO. I am not sure what would have happened if contractors failed to deliver or other problems concerning the quality of the work delivered would have come up. Generally it is an open ended debate just how much of a contract a smart-contract is to begin with. The problem of interpreting even seemingly clear statements was strikingly illustrated when the countdown for the DAO tokensale at full discount went one day longer than expected because there was confusion if ""in 14 days"" means after day 14 or on the 14thed day...

Hypothetically, just to give an absurd example, an Energy Grid Distribution DAO would require everyone able to make decisions to be an Electrical Engineer.",t3_6jelnp,lbalan79
"When a contract in the future is coded with an error that causes stakeholders to lose their investment, how do they propose that the entire ledger/system retro-actively change the system in order to recuperate losses?  This would not even be an option if the DAO wasn't so large and partially funded by the developers themselves.  Ethereum wasn't hacked, a contract written using Ethereum ecosystem was (and even the word ""hack"" is debatable).  A singular contract issue causing a change in the entire blockchain because there was a flaw is only possible because the stakeholders have enough power, essentially wagging the dog.  It destroys both ""Decentralized"" and ""Automonous"" aspects of the DAO, which only leaves one letter left in their chosen acronym.  I have sold all my ETH after reading the proposed solutions because they seem heavy-handed, dangerous and myopic.  I am not angry at people trying to do what they can to correct an unfortunate mistake, but I think it's the wrong choice.  I hope Ethereum survives and flourishes even stronger after this incident, but cannot support a fork in good conscience.",t3_4ot5ot,yuikl
"So, i'm sympathetic to this argument, but at its core, it's a 'slippery slope' argument. And always a slippery slope derives its teeth from the threat of the slide. How far down do we go? Certainly if anyone in the future loses a few hundred eth debugging their contract, they may indeed want the community to fork to recover that eth and they are free to propose that. But nobody is likely to listen to them, because the quantity involved isn't sufficiently compelling to anyone other than them. Is this fair? Of course not. But that's exactly why it resolves the argument. You are arguing that, how can we, in good conscience, fork for the DAO and not for everyone else? And the answer is that good conscience is not a component of this discussion. We can rely on the miners to act in their own self-interest and nothing else. And their self-interest simply doesn't dictate that they should fork for one individual's lost money. Now you might reasonably ask: but doesn't this mean we're vulnerable to a situation where all the miners are invested in something, and that investment goes south for more legitimate reasons and they try to take their money back? No. Because if they did something like that the value of ether would collapse in an instant if it looked like it was going to pass, which would presumably be far worse for their collective welfare. It is only possible for this fork to go through because it is in the interest of the currency for it to do so. Slippery slope arguments about fairness and moral hazard are truly irrelevant here. Self interest is the only regulating force at work, and it bends towards a soft-fork.",t3_4ot5ot,darawk
"Honest question: If Ethereum is to become consensus based, what makes it special compared to the other coins out there? I really thought the main feature of Ethereum was its ""Code as Law"" smart contracts. If the fork goes through such that consensus is law, what makes Ethereum special? Why should someone pick Ethereum over other consensus as law coins? Say if Bitcoin manages to get fast transactions running properly, is there any reason to pick Ethereum then? These aren't rhetorical questions btw. I am really looking for an answer.",t3_4ot5ot,[deleted]
"And actually I would like to follow up with another comment: What makes a fund like the DAO superior to a ""normal"" investment fund?. Had the DAO just been a normal investment fund, it's very likely that Slock.it would be in the process of making their product already. If the product fails, people can then (potentially) bring up a lawsuit and be compensated. Otherwise, if a heist occurs, the legal system as well as the banks will be on the hunt for the attacker. If the fund managers negligence caused the funds to be stolen, they too can be forced to pay compensation. Stuff like insider trading (for instance, Vitalik has some DAO tokens??? - is this akin to insider trading??), if found, would be punished. Furthermore the investment is made in fiat, so the shares can be sold in fiat - which is undeniably more stable and useful than a cryptocurrency. And, the contract will be done in plain language, which people have far more experience in deciphering, instead of obtuse code. To my mind there were 2 perceivable benefits to investing via Ethereum into the DAO: 1. Anonymity. 2. Code as law. Anonymity - I personally don't think that this is a benefit as, whenever possible, I don't want to be investing in something where I don't know the other people who are putting money into it. But I can understand the need for anonymity. For instance, I can understand someone who wants to invest in a weed growing project can do it anonymously, but big scale investors would likely not dabble in this stuff. Code as Law - This was where I thought things were most interesting. The idea that, a contract, when put into code can never ever be changed (no matter who wants it to), and forever enforced. I thought about this for a long time, then realised that no code is infallible - what if a code is bugged and I was forced to go with it forever? Oh god no. That was when I sold the DAO tokens I bought earlier. And now with the impending fork and Vitalik's statement that Ethereum is not ready for smart contracts to become its own thing yet, the potential for this feature to become a selling point for investors has just been pushed back greatly. It might not even become a reality. So now, I'm left wondering what are the benefits to a DAO style investment? Had the DAO been a more ""fiat style"" investment, I would be better protected against all the bad things that have happened so far.",t3_4ot5ot,[deleted]
"Great explanation, thanks.  We'll see how the miners react to the options presented.  I may be out of the game as far as personal fiscal investment, but I'm very interested in how this plays out.

"Thank you for replying like a human.  I really do appreciate it. The DAO holders definitely want their money back (who wouldn't).  That's correct. There is only the will of the miners in PoW currencies.  A vote of hashpower is currently underway to undo what appears to be an attack on the Ether ecosystem.  Just like the code allows, if the majority of miners support returning the funds, there's no right or wrong in it. What I'm seeing is people, like yourself, who seem to think the network is zero sum, and that Rayndian ""fuck the losers"" is the only way to play it. Nobody loses in a soft fork, or even a hard fork scenario.  There's no ""bailout"", because there's no external funding.  It's a do-over in a young project that allowed one portion of itself to get reckless where doing nothing destroys the roadmap and utility of future projects within itself. I don't think a fork punishes anyone external to theDAO.  In fact, if and when theDAO is made whole by a hardfork, they have already stated and developed a system to return the funds to the users of this theft and close up shop. Other contracts are already keenly aware of the vulnerabilities in their code.  This mistake will not be made again. I am not in favor of perpetually forking to save other victims of theft due to their carelessness, and I will not vote with my hashpower to do so in the future.  But I am in favor of using the amazing power of the blockchain to ignore the thief's claim to a contractual oversight in this instance. After all, the D in DAO  doesn't  stand for decentralized.  It stands for democratic.",t3_4ot5ot,myownman

Bitcoin is stronger now that mt gox was expunged from the system and ethereum will be stronger after this version of the dao is expunged from the system, making way for solid, more sound and reliable dao systems.

This fork needs to be kept simple and uncontroversial, in order to have a high probability of passing. A follow-up soft fork could whitelist a ""trusted hero"" account (e.g. the curators multi-sig, Slock.it, or a newly formed group of experts) which will be the only one allowed to perform DAO transactions (or any other actions). This account should then be able to take control of all dark-DAOs (more of which should be expected to appear before the first fork happens). The ""trusted hero"" account should however also have some limits imposed. Mainly, it should only be allowed to send ether (via a DAO proposal) to a pre-determined address - which should be a pre-deployed simple contract (possibly an upgraded DAO contract?) which only allows withdrawal by token holders. This limitation should be in place in order to ensure that the ""trusted hero"" can't be compelled to divert the ETH somewhere else. Let me know if I'm missing something.",t3_4ov5yi,Onestone

"Whether the stolen ETH are burnt, given to the Ethereum foundation, or simply given back to its original owners is a decision for the community to make. The Ethereum Foundation could at least give the community a chance to decide whether to give the funds back to their respectful owners (i.e. a hard fork software release).

"So this is what I've gathered needs to happen. This is also changing the soft fork currently proposed (freeze all tx based on hash) to have exceptions, and part of that exception is the ""governing body"" of Ethereum, which will obviously make a lot of folks uncomfortable. This is better than specific blacklist of an address, but is still is essentially resulting in a user-based blacklist / whitelist. IMO, this is also a dangerous precedent and I actually am more okay with the ""precedent"" the currently-proposed HF sets. Unless it is executed absolutely perfectly, any number of outside factors could make this not work. All the stuff in order to get a ""good guy"" into the child dao Create soft fork to prevent the attacker from doing things Make sure the soft fork doesn’t prevent the “good guy” from being able to counter attack / move the eth Make sure no one else drains the DAO or any other child DAOs or the dark DAO to a new address before this happens or else the plan just got much more widespread.  Just realized: Is the plan to blacklist all transactions based on hash except for one address in all DAOs with hash? Pass the soft fork Pray to VB that no one else drains the DAO or any other child DAOs or the dark DAO after the fork... or does anything to otherwise disrupt our plan. ""Good guy"" in child dao exploits into a new child dao. Wait Move all ETH in new child of Dark DAO to a withdrawOnly() contract. ?? Move all ETH from Main DAO into a withdrawOnly() contract ?? ?? Deal with other child DAOS that aren't the dark DAO ??? ?? Deal with any DAOs on the chain with same hash than have a balance ?? This is the thing: a soft fork is more appealing than a hard fork if you are just looking at the words. In reality, a soft fork can be more detrimental than a hard fork in terms of what is acceptable and unacceptable. Blacklisting addresses or people is....scary. What would be doubly tragic would be the case that we get halfway through this and something happens that makes the plan incomplete-able, or the soft fork accidentally f***s an totally innocent and unrelated party. This is also potentially an issue with the currently proposed soft fork. Lastly, we need to accept that all DAOs are broken and cannot hold ETH. Therefore, at the end of the day: nothing is changed and it's a free for all for who gets the ETH (do nothing option) everything needs to be frozen (current soft fork option) moving all extrabalance, the remaining DAO funds, and the funds of all child DAOs to a contract where you can only withdraw proportionally to what you had initially put in (current hard fork option) In your proposed soft fork option we would need to figure out a way to move all extrabalance, the remaining DAO funds, and the funds of all child DAOs to a contract where you can only withdraw. So would that be an action the curators / whoever is whitelisted would take? In that case, we would need that whitelisted address to enter all child DAOs.",t3_4ov5yi,insomniasexx

What will happen to all legitimate child DAO's that have been created after the attack? Keep in mind that people have split with less than they should be entitled to.

"yes, i agree with  /u/akhanaton . Since the recovered ether from the darkdao would amount to a lot more ether than tokens burnt, they would more than make up for the shortfall ether of the other post-attack child daos in ether when their tokens were burnt.

And i seriously don't understand why these proposals are just mentioned 3 days before the voting end in some reddit post. As grateful as i am for all this, we need better communication!

Maybe it is who we surround ourselves with, but at least the discussion has been civil and very eye opening to the pro's and con's of either side. I still see a majority supporting it, Much like the soft fork had the acceptance of the community by the non-votes following the majority, therefore giving it consensus of 90%+ of hashpower, the same I believe will become of the HF, maybe not full consensus, but it will be a rough consensus where the majority of miners will follow the larger group, which in this case looks to be the HF.",t3_4r89jq,happythots

"Well, what I meant is you would quickly see economic reasons to converge with any majority.

"Once the super-majority of community voted for hard fork, I accepted it and after the hard fork smoothly passed, I thought this is done deal. I was really surprised to see there is now motivation to run two seperate chains. Once you understand how the vote happened. It should be obvious why you shouldn't be surprised at all. A super majority of 'the community'  did not  vote for the fork. A super majority of  voters  did. But a super majority of all eth didn't even vote! There is 82m eth in existence. Only 1.55m eth voted for the fork either for or against. The vast, vast majority of eth holders did not even vote. The very idea that ""the community"" voted for a hard fork is wishful thinking. It should not be surprising at all that the 98% of eth that didn't vote might have other ideas!",t3_4untrq,Economist_hat
"I am in that 98% as I did not vote. The reason why (and I can imagine most of the others did not vote for the same reason) is because I did not have a huge preference for or against the fork. I was leaning more towards pro fork, but not significantly. In the end I did not vote because I would just follow whatever the majority vote would be amongst the people that would vote. I supported whatever the foundation would offer as a remedy and whatever the miners would vote for after that. I did not care that much as long as we all would stick together. I'm very sad to see that in the end we still ended up with 2 chains. All it took was 1 exchange that supported it which gave ETC some legitimacy. After that the price goes up so people start mining it. As hashrate moves to ETC, it gives it even more legitimacy which pumps the price up even more. About 20% of the hashrate and 20% of the value is in ETC now, if 20% of people would really feel this is the chain with the most promising future they would have voted against the HF before and since only such a small amount of ETH has voted, they would have won the vote. TLDR: Most of the people are ok with the HF and stand by it. The 20% value in ETC just comes from people who see the price going up so they want to profit from it as well, that's a short term play. Has nothing to do with them opposing the fork.",t3_4untrq,SiskoYU

That reaked pretty bad from the very start. You talk about conspiracies, yet this smelled pretty fishy to me.

"Even with two chains, Ethereum as a technology is prospering. The cumulative value of Ethereum is relatively stable, especially given all the recent turmoil. This is a great sign. I expect ETC to embrace little change in terms of hard forking in the future. This chain will almost definitely remain PoW. ETH, on the other hand, will pioneer PoS, and serve people with a different ideology (I'd argue the original ""Ethereum ideology""). Both chains could hold value and serve different use-cases, as long as the market demands it! At their core, both chains are the same world-computer, smart contract running platform... the only difference right now is opinion: immutability, whether or not a thief should control 15% of the ecosystem.

I doubt an experiment would be able to match that simply due to lack of funds, so whoever tries this out will probably need to run many experiments with different levels of monetary incentives to see if there are any patterns to be discerned as the reward increases. That would be necessary in order to make the attempt at projecting out to real-world stakes. EDIT: As a specific example, let's take this scenario: Launch a separate smart contract where some specific set of users is rewarded if the average market price exceeds 5; the more it exceeds 5 the higher their reward. This encourages them to try to manipulate the market upwards. See how well the market manages to keep the price close to 5. And so here you're saying someone has to select manipulators.

"About the ""51% DAO attacks"": an alternative to the ""pile in even more money"" solution is to give the good guys the option of  forking  the DAO. This is from slock.it: ""If someone was to acquire 51% of the DAO tokens, they could [...] send 100% of the funds to their own account. In order to prevent this, the DAO is able to split itself proportionally to the vote results, leaving the attacker with their funds and the rest of the participants in control of their own."" From the history the development of open source software, we already know that forking to resolve disagreement works (more or less, at least for some cases). The possibility of forking to protect against a 51% attack would only work for DAOs that derive (a significant part of) their value from something that is ""splittable"" in some meaningful way that can be formally specified by the contract itself. For example, money is easily divided. If the DAO is an investment fund that invests in the stock market, it can be easily forked, and no investor in the minority will be much the worse for it after a split. However, if a DAO derives most of its value from assets that are unique (the name of a Brand, a CEO, the Bitcoin Blockchain), a fork is not an option. A bit more difficult to split a DAO that derives its value from the collective set of its users, like, say, an insurance contract, or a Ponzi scheme, or ""a social network"". But ways to split up such a network can be imagined, and if the value of a DAO is greater than the sum of its parts, a fork would mean that all participants loose. They would, therefore, have an incentive to negotiate some kind of compromise (which may be good or bad, depending).",t3_453sid,jelleg

"I am somewhat embarrassed at a glaring omission in my  other comments . For whatever reason, we all missed something rather fundamental about some of these experiments, especially the Market Manipulation one, and that is that for this experiment to be successful it would require a serious breach of ethics (""professional"" and otherwise), as it would require the deliberate deception and manipulation of innocent people for pure financial gain on the part of the manipulators. This experiment would not pass any serious ERB (Ethical Review Board), and as such, even if it were possible (miraculously) to do a good job of it, it would be wrong to do so.",t3_453sid,itistoday
"Umm, the only people being manipulated by any of the experiments that I describe are voluntary participants in the experiments.",t3_453sid,vbuterin
"Umm, the only people being manipulated by any of the experiments that I describe are voluntary participants in the experiments. You'll have to explain how that works in greater detail then. How on earth does manipulating someone who knows they're going to be manipulated (financially) at all represent the unsuspecting victims of real-world manipulation?",t3_453sid,itistoday
"Remember that the purpose of this particular experiment was to determine the manipulability of decision markets for DAOs; this is a rather different scenario from traditional stock markets. The kind of ""manipulation"" being described here has  the DAO making the decision market  as its intended victim, not the participants, and the DAOs here are created solely for the sake of the experiment; outside DAOs are not used. As far as the similarity between these experiments and the real world, I think that people will expect decision markets to be continued targets of manipulation even in the real world and act accordingly; perhaps they will be somewhat less paranoid, as here there is a very large explicit incentive to manipulate and there the incentive may only sometimes exist, though on the other hand the actual level of manipulation in the experiments should be higher.",t3_453sid,vbuterin
"The kind of ""manipulation"" being described here has the DAO making the decision market as its intended victim, not the participants I don't see how that's true. You say there's a market that's being manipulated. Who is participating in that market? Whoever it is, is a victim if they are fooled by deception to bet money on the wrong outcome of the smart contract.",t3_453sid,itistoday
"Whoever it is, is a victim if they are fooled by deception to bet money So there are a few types of manipulation. One involves misleading people in order to try to make them bet incorrectly. Another involves simply purchasing shares on the market to try to push the price up, because you care about the price for unrelated reasons (such as because some DAO is making decisions based on the price). I think you have the first in mind whereas I have the second.",t3_453sid,vbuterin
"One involves misleading people in order to try to make them bet incorrectly. Another involves simply purchasing shares on the market to try to push the price up, because you care about the price for unrelated reasons (such as because some DAO is making decisions based on the price). I think you have the first in mind whereas I have the second. I don't see much of a difference. Here is the setup you described: Launch a prediction market on ""what will the output of this smart contract be on Mar 30, 2016?"". The contract will be simply and verifiably coded to output 5. Launch a separate smart contract where some specific set of users is rewarded if the average market price exceeds 5; the more it exceeds 5 the higher their reward. This encourages them to try to manipulate the market upwards. See how well the market manages to keep the price close to 5. The person who is fooled to buy above 5 could end up losing money (with high probability). The experiment encourages manipulators, who know what the outcome should be, to deceive folks that don't have that information. If the price closes above 5 the manipulators are rewarded, but for this to be a real experiment there needs to be an opposite group of insiders betting against them (shorting). Either way, you've got insider trading and a setup for creating victims out of those who aren't insiders, that seems to me like a fertile environment for creating real financial victims.",t3_453sid,itistoday
"It's the manipulators themselves who are buying above 5, in order to attain the secondary reward that they get for pushing the market price up.",t3_453sid,vbuterin
"It's the manipulators themselves who are buying above 5, in order to attain the secondary reward that they get for pushing the market price up. How does the market (to group excluding the manipulators) have any basis then for knowing what the price should be? In most markets there is a range consisting of an almost absolute lower bound on the price and an upper bound. But this range is always based on some information that's knowable to participants (book value, etc.). Without this information there is no reason to bet on the market in the first place. Is it stated someplace (with a proof of sorts) that the contract outputs 5? EDIT: Even if it is stated someplace (with a proof), this creates two groups: insiders who see the proof, and outsiders that don't. The insiders that see the proof and are not manipulators will be shorting. The manipulators will be trying to convince outsiders to buy  if  they can make more money by doing so than by joining the insiders that are shorting  and  it is worth their time to do so. Meanwhile the outsiders will either buy at or below 5, in which case there is a small probability of loss, or they will be fooled into buying above 5, in which case there is a much higher probability of loss. Either way, this experiment sets up a stage for some unsuspecting person to get screwed.",t3_453sid,itistoday
"Is it stated someplace (with a proof of sorts) that the contract outputs 5? Yes. That's the whole point. The manipulators will be trying to convince outsiders to buy if they can make more money by doing so than by joining the insiders that are shorting and it is worth their time to do so. So you are suggesting that the manipulators will try to seek out some random people from the public, convince them that the asset should be worth 7 and get them to buy it? Sure, that's theoretically plausible. But I fail to see why it's any easier to do that with this scheme than just letting the manipulators get together and try to convince people to buy AmericanCoin.",t3_453sid,vbuterin

"There are also plenty of skeptics who are established accounts here. Ether.camp could do several things to improve matters much more than moving to a new forum system.

Right now HKG would have the same value whether ether.camp raises $50K or $50M. Given that they are taking the ether for themselves, they could at least say what they're going to use the money for. We don't know whether it'll be invested in the ecosystem or used to buy yachts, and so far they've refrained from answering  questions  about that.

The worst thing is that crowd funding is planned in 7 days and this is not nearly enough time for the public to review security of the code even if he had released it today. This is completely unprofessional, and even if you look at the DAO, the code was published at least a month prior to the crowdsale.

We don’t need to cheer everything on. Circle jerk mentality and hubris is what got us into the DAO. Sometimes it’s ugly — but outside perspective is important.

"I thought this all was already thoroughly discussed in your previous post? F2pool the second largest mining pool (which may change) will mine it. This is not confirmed. See comment from  Vitalik . Old ethereum will be a viable alt coin and will make miners money. This can be true, but doesn't have to be true. General theory is that the losing chain eventually dies out completely. It is an opinion you have, but you state it as if it is a fact. It is very hard to know at this point what the value of the losing chain will be. On the other hand, in the case the Morden testnet vs Main net, we know there will be parallel chains, and a protocol change was made to use non-overlapping nonces to prevent the replay attacks – why are we ignoring the same threat here? It can be argued this is a good thing. You are recommended to choose one chain, and stick to it only. Otherwise, you are at risk if you don't know what you are doing. This is one reason why it is not a viable option to continue using the losing chain. I am not trying to spread FUD FUD  is defined as ""Fear"", ""Uncertainty"" and ""Doubt"". I think you fulfill all of those attributes. The answer is simple: stay with thew winning chain, and there are no problems.",t3_4t82uq,LarsPensjo
"General theory is that the losing chain eventually dies out completely. What underpins this theory? I agree with it, in the sense that eventually every currency dies out completely. The fact is, we have no way of knowing what happens. This is new territory. Most people are fearful when they don't really have any idea what will happen.",t3_4t82uq,sfultong
"There are couple of reasons for this: Network effect. E.g. Augur will prefer the chain with the most users, because that is where there will be most liquidity. This will be a self reinforcing incentive for users to choose this chain. The replay attack is a complication. There are solutions, but I think it will make people stay  away. Suppose 75% goes with one chain. They now have two sets of ether, and if there is a market for ether on the minor chain they can sell these. That can lead to a high sell pressure on the price and I doubt the followers of the minor chain are going to step in and buy all this. #2 is somewhat a contradiction to this, but it is enough if a few whales takes this step. If there is a high sell pressure on ethC, miners will get small rewards. That will drive miners away. If #4 happens, the total hash rate will be low, making for an insecure network. Making a 51% attack becomes easier.",t3_4t82uq,LarsPensjo
"Those are all valid reasons for weakness in the minority chain, but there's a long way between a weak chain and a dead chain.",t3_4t82uq,sfultong
"True. My own definition of ""die out completely"" is when there are no discussions about it in the Ethereum forum, except as a reference. I think that will eventually be the case, regardless of which fork wins.",t3_4t82uq,LarsPensjo
So just to clarify my understanding. Cross chain replay attacks are a real thing. (They can even be useful for testing) This  is  a serious problem  if  you want to use both chains. This  is not  a serious problem  if  you only ever use one chain. If you really want to use both chains you need to ensure that your accounts are different on each chain e.g. by using  tjade273's proposed approach  or some other method which distinguishes between chains. So basically there can only be one winning chain. All users and exchanges have to pick a side and if you never transact on the losing chain you are ok. But this should be fixed in future so that future forks don't have this issue. Is this understanding correct?,t3_4t82uq,Dunning_Krugerrands

"What would be the incentive to support the old chain? The reason I see people don't want to fork is because they don't want DTHs to get their ether back. If miners support the fork, wouldn't that chain last long enough for most people to get their ether out of the DAO? If they're worried about the old chain dominating, they can trade that ether for btc until they're positive which won. IMO, being able to trade a old coin on an exchange seems like it'd take a long time to gain popularity and become the strongest ethereum. It would need dev support, community support, etc. Which all takes time to form and gain faith. Meanwhile, DTHs are recovering their ether.",t3_4t82uq,CryptoAnthony

"Ah, I see. I was cloudy on the reasons. Thanks for explaining.",t3_4t82uq,CryptoAnthony

"I'm a noob  and I can say after all I think I understood the issue. Replay attacks will be a daily problem. But now it is too late. Assuming there will be an hardfork, ethereum classic will become a kind of little hacky-land. (someone will call it ETHack) This is the best of our options at this point.  Unaware people will focus on their precious ETH and part of ETHC will be stolen, lost, stuck somewhere. The situation is pretty interesting. Poloniex offered to withdraw ETHC. so if you keep your ETH in a different exchange (or not in your wallet) all your ETHC will be taken by someone else (the owners of that wallet where you, unaware, send your ETH). Pratically ETHC will become a crazy REdistribution of clone coins, operating clone dapps. ETHC is a coin like: If You Can Take It So Is Yours: IYCTISIY. I officially suggest to call it IYCTISIY instead of ETHC. This will produce a lot of bad news connected to ETH, while the most of crazyness will happen in IYCTISIY. We aren't a normal society. In a different situation the splitting of ETH would be a really interesting social and economical experiment! All hackers are going to mine ethc, and try to fuck each others. So yes, I beliieve there will be miners! Time ago Someone asked: So how long for an eth blackmarket? well...here's your candidate: ETH will apply censorship to the blackmarket. ETHC will never do it. So what is going to happen? the two system may seriously differenciate from each other. Interesting (crazy) times. But ...Things could go worse. so let's see. no panic, just good luck!

We should be careful not to accidentally make things worse by making statements like that. For me personally: A serious bug in ethereum itself is sufficient to warrant a fork. A serious bug in solidity that affects very many contracts may be. Anything with less than ~50% community support should not happen.

"I would argue that saying ""hard forks are ok to rescue >10% of ether"" outright is a terrible idea as that would definitely increase moral hazard. In a simple one period game setup – I agree with you. If a contract attracts more than x% of Ether, it will be bailed out whatever the contract quality, and that would create a negative bias for coding quality in big ventures. If we model the game closer to reality, I’m not sure anymore. Reason: Funding of venture / dao is proportional to attractiveness. Community has learned – bigger the security level of the contract, the higher the venture attractiveness everything else kept equal. There are other factors that determine how much funding a venture gets (e.g., what kind of client needs are  addressed, how big is potential customer base, how innovative a solution etc). Thus: E(funding level) = probabilistic function (Security level, other factors) If smart contract coding is sloppy – the risk is for the venture behind is double: a) it will raise less capital b) as it stays under the threshold due to sloppy coding, there will be no bailout Thus, there is a  double incentive for coding sound contracts with a threshold . We need to make sure that the threshold is: High enough so that only a small portion of ventures will be bailed out Small enough not to hurt the Ethereum eco-system when ventures are not bailed out It would be very interesting in this context to have Economists chiming in who have a founded (maybe simulation based) opinion how much of a currency can be “safely” locked up in a system before creating significant trouble.",t3_4pgf03,m88888m

"The problem with ~50% consensus is similar to the problem of prediction markets. At what point is it triggered?

(this is besides the fact that redditors may not be representative of ether holders as a whole) I believe you wrote something about sampling the market over a certain period of time past the ""close date"" with regards to prediction markets.

"Broadly speaking I think this is a good idea, to have a consensus ahead of time so people ""know the rules"" about something they are investing in. A couple observations/concerns: Obviously, this should not (and presumably won't) have the force of law. Whatever guidelines are drawn up now, by current parties, may change as opinions and participants change. So no one should make the mistake of thinking anything is set in stone. Is there a scenario in which someone in the ethereum ecosystem could bring legal action based on the guidelines? For example, let's say someone loses funds in a future DAO hack and the guidelines indicate some sort of action be taken, but for whatever reason no action or different action is taken. Could this open some parties to a lawsuit? One problem I have with issuing such guidelines (though I do support the concept) is that attackers will have an idea of how much damage they can do without instigating a robust response. For example, what if The DAO attacker had only taken 1/10 of the ether that he did? How would that affect the momentum for a soft fork and/or hard fork? Knowing the likely response to crises will help potential investors and businesses getting involved with ethereum to map out the risks and their strategies to cope in response.

I'm a CPA & an auditor in the US and have been thinking about how blockchain might disrupt the assurance services industry.

There's definitely garbage in/garbage out issues to consider spending on how the system is established.,t3_5w0lqo,BlakeChain
I think real life applications will get more complex than that - malformed contracts or failed external data hooks will mean that good inputs turn into bad outputs.

"The revolution is yet to be seen, but there's sufficient interest from major corporates to see that there's a future in Blockchain as a wider technology.

"(iii) being vulnerable to ""speculative attacks"" where attackers short the currency in very large volumes, eventually breaking the peg and profiting from the massive resulting fall in price. I think that we should highlight more that stablecoin models backed by  public and liquid  collateral markets (shares in seignorage shares system, collateral bonds in liquid collateral markets, the B asset in the A/B scheme) introduce new speculative vulnerabilities because they create a new public and free market that affects the price, supply or robustness of the underlying stablecoins (that are also vulnerable to attacks). Imho, these models are really weak at low scale. The shares, the bonds, the ""B assets"" are vulnerable to speculative attacks if the Marketcap of these markets is not high enough or its distribution is not transparent enough. Here is an ""artificial leverage attack"". I buy lot of shares/ bonds/ B assets 2. Thanks to this a lot (or cheap depending on the models) of stablecoins/A assets will be available. 3. I buy a lot of stablecoins/ A assets. 4. I sell my shares / bonds / B assets. The attacker has artificially increased the supply of stablecoins (or dumped the price) by entering the collateral/backing market, bought part of this extra supply and then exited. Original backers (share/bond/B holders) that were not aware/part of these large buy and sell operations are weakened (they now support a doped stablecoin market: or they can't exit anymore, or they have assets which price has decreased. The overall model is also weakened: if the price of the underlying asset that backs stablecoins drops, shareholders are more vulnerable. All these initiatives are close to autonomous public companies which sell stablecoins and buyback them (i.e their shareholders buy/sell the non stable part of the underlying asset). Public companies have legislation for large buy/sell events(public offers, public bidding, extraordinary shareholders meetings) to protect shareholders and the company. I think these kind of regulations should be adapted in the crypto autonomous world. For the seignorage shares system, we could think for instance of shares that are only tradable during transparent, periodic and limited in time auctions. That way speculative attacks would be public and shareholders could react. PS: I think there is a typo: price(A) = min (P', P/2).",t3_4xtd9z,hcharlanes
"Preventing trading in crypto land is imo impossible; you can always at the least create a wrapper contract around an asset and freely trade shares of that.

I buy lot of shares/ bonds/ B assets * 2. Thanks to this a lot (or cheap depending on the models) of stablecoins/A assets will be available. I have no idea how (2) follows from (1) in the stablecoin model. In the tranche model, sure, I can see how buying up B will increase the supply of A, but the process by which that happens is itself a process which drains money from the attacker (as if you push B up to the point where A + B > ether, then people will convert their ether into A + B and sell you their B).

Are we required to convert DAO tokens back into ETH? Or simply it's an offer? Will the DAO go back into an active phase soon?,t3_532523,ion-tom
This The DAO is inactive and will never be re-activated. If you want to retrieve the funds that you originally invested then you will need to execute the appropriate withdrawal contracts to receive the ETHs (or ETCs).,t3_532523,BokkyPooBah
The easiest way to get your refunds is using MyEtherWallet v3.3.7. See Griff's post  https://medium.com/curator-multisig-phf-official-channel/dao-token-holders-come-claim-your-money-b428f186572a#.cj95ba858  for the details. Note the Apr 15 time limit on the ETC refunds.,t3_532523,BokkyPooBah
"Preface : I know I screwed up twice, but I am just wondering if anyone knows of a way to correct my problem. I used the myetherwallet.com/#the-dao tool to tokenize my ~9 ETH (mistake #1 not testing with a tiny amount first), but had a brain lock and sent the tokens to my 'newest' ETH account to be sure I had no replay issues, but that account is on the freewallet.org android app (mistake #2, using an account I don't have the private key/.json for), which doesn't appear to allow me to access the tokens. I see through etherscan that the tokens were transferred to the freewallet ETH account, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to complete the second step of the process. It's not much ETH, so I'm not too worried, but if there's a way to complete the process using freewallet, I would like to know.",t3_532523,sharpenedrose
You should try to somehow extract the private key from that android app. And then you can use it via myEtherWallet,t3_532523,ledgerwatch
I've opened a support ticket with freewallet also to see if there is a way to get the key. I don't blame freewallet for my mistakes and the myEtherWallet team has been awesome making this as smooth as possible for my ETH and ETC withdrawals. I will likely donate whatever I recover to the myEtherWallet team as thanks.,t3_532523,sharpenedrose

"you Eth guys are naive idiots. The whitehat is actaully the blackhat. The blackhat doesn't want to crash Ethereum/New DAO. The blackhat wants to spend his stolen Eth for good money. So if i was the blackhat, I would steal some and then do a whitehat stunt to prevent others from stealing... This is so clear!!!",t3_6obc3o,Mordan
I think the blackhat hacker limited his theft to only 3 accounts to prevent a crash and could easily predict the whitehat operation.  I don't think it's likely they are one and the same. You can reach the same conclusion regarding the intentions of the blackhat not wanting to crash ethereum simply by looking at the limited scope of his attack without making the more conspiracy-theory-ish leap to saying they are the same.,t3_6obc3o,x_ETHeREAL_x
yes.. your theory is valid as well. but less probable. Why isn't there more account stolen? How does the blackhat communicate to a real whitehat? Why would the blackhat wait for a whitehat to appear.. That's lot of risks. Another blackhat can appear anytime. EDIT: that new blackhat might decide to steal everything! because he wants Eth to crash :),t3_6obc3o,Mordan
"There was actually a long wait/delay between the original blackhat theft and the whitehat intervention -- about 12 hours. There is no evidence of any communication from the attacker, so not sure what you're referring to.  It's also not really a secret who the WH group is any more (note the same address was used in the DAO WH operations). The blackhat stole the money, Swarm city saw it was stolen and immediately started working with the foundation and ethcore (Parity) to track down the issue.  Then the WH group (which is foundation guys, but the one publicly known member is avsa) executed a sweep to prevent additional thefts, but this was a long time later.  It's clear that the attacker limited the attack to prevent a crash.  Given that timeline, it seems unlikely that they are the thief is the same as the WH group that did the community sweep.",t3_6obc3o,x_ETHeREAL_x
ok well. didn't know about the 12 hours. then yes. attacker is probably a different guy.,t3_6obc3o,Mordan

"Continuously having hard forks on the ethereum blockchain goes against what the original intentions of what contracts were made for. A contract should be instilled and irreversible. Likewise, if a hard fork occurs that reverses something, then that goes against fundamental principles. There are, of course, cases that are rare and very impactful such as the DAO hack.

"""Rolling back the chain"" is the simplest way to explain it, without actually getting into the semantic difference between ""rolling back"" and ""non-standard state changes."" From an outsider's perspective, $55M worth of Ether was stolen--then the developers did some stuff, and suddenly it wasn't anymore.  It was as if the theft never happened, or had been ""rolled back."" You only care about the semantic difference because you understand that difference.  To someone who doesn't understand how a blockchain works at all, the difference doesn't matter, nor should it.",t3_5gbkvq,DeviateFish_
"I think the main reason why the ""rolling back the chain"" description is bad is that to many it implies that we erased the  entire 34 days of history  between the hack and the fork, including the activities of everyone else's contracts. That would of course be vastly more objectionable and I would never have stood for it.",t3_5gbkvq,vbuterin
"Again, to those that don't really understand the specifics of a blockchain, ""rolling back"" a theft doesn't necessarily imply rolling back everything that happened between the theft and the time of the rollback. Most people are more familiar with credit cards than blockchain; if you ""roll back"" a theft of your card, it's understood that only the fraudulent transactions are reversed. Apply the same context here, without the context of understanding how a blockchain works, and you can easily see that ""rolling back"" the theft only implies that the fraud was reversed, and doesn't speak to any of the other transactions in the interim. The issue, of course, is when someone who does understand a blockchain (enough) reads it, and interprets it the way you or I would--but those people are far from being an even significant minority of their audience.",t3_5gbkvq,DeviateFish_
"For what it's worth I've never heard the terminology of ""rolling back a credit card payment"" before; I've only heard ""reversing"", and ""rolling back the chain"" (Charlie's original words) to me quite literally means rolling back the  entire  chain, not ""rolling back a theft"". So I think the linguistic context that you're bringing up might be far less universal than you might think. Edit: also, I'm a stickler for this because I have seen at least one person who actually thought that we did roll back 35 days of history of the entire chain to revert the theft.",t3_5gbkvq,vbuterin
"You're a stickler for it because you've seen the tiny slice of the layman audience that knows enough about blockchains to understand what ""rolling back"" means in the blockchain context. That's, again, far from even a significant minority of their target audience--a target audience who would easily get lost if they dove into the semantics of ""non-standard state changes"" vs ""rolling back the chain"" vs ""rolling back the theft"" vs ""undoing the theft."" For either of us, those all have slightly different connotations.  For the layman, the first two don't really mean anything, and the second two are identical.",t3_5gbkvq,DeviateFish_
"Sure, so I'd be somewhat ok with using ""rolling back the theft"" - but DEFINITELY not ""rolling back the chain"".",t3_5gbkvq,vbuterin
"The quote in question, from the article: The nonprofit that runs ether, Ethereum Foundation, just rolled back the chain. It's as if the hack never took place, and business returned to normal. It's not wrong, except for the semantics of rolling back the ""chain.""  It's true, it's as if the theft never happened.  That's the important part. Getting up in arms because they chose to write ""rolling back the chain"" instead of ""rolling back the theft"" is really just kind of silly. Pick your battles, etc.",t3_5gbkvq,DeviateFish_
"I continue to think that the distinction is not silly at all. As I said, I've talked to someone who actually thought that we rolled back 35 days of the entire chain history in a literal sense, and I imagine quite a few more laymen get this connotation than we might realize. It's 2016; laymen know what chains are, though I agree they don't know what state changes are at this point so a better term would be good. The bitcoin media being hyperbolic about the notion that we  violated the fundamental concept of a blockchain also doesn't help; I can  imagine at least a few people thinking ""whoa, it sounds like these people really did something horrible, it must have been something like rolling back the entire chain and not just fiddling with one account"". The fact that the fork was a surgical intervention against one specific account is something that absolutely does need to be conveyed.",t3_5gbkvq,vbuterin
"Okay, sure, but how long did it take you to set him straight on the matter? Did you ask him where he obtained his misconception, and then point out it wasn't really written for someone who actually understands blockchains?  It might be 2016, but the actual number of people who understand blockchains is probably only in the tens of thousands.  The number of people who have heard of them is orders of magnitude larger, but there's a vast difference between hearing of ""Bitcoin"" or ""blockchains"" and having even the most basic understanding of them. To be honest, though, I am on the side of thinking that you did do something that fundamentally violates the principles that a blockchain is ""supposed to"" uphold.  Granted, one's ideals for a blockchain are entirely subjective, because many of them are just things that are supposed to be incentivized by the system, but in reality aren't, or aren't correctly, or the incentives give rise to a behavior that's not quite expected, etc. I think conveying that the fork was a ""surgical intervention against one specific account"" is exactly the way you  don't  want to put it, especially if your goal is to promote Ethereum.  Promoting ""surgical intervention against one account"" is literally promoting censorship. That's not a quality  anyone  wants to see in a blockchain, regardless of whose account is being censored, or how much ""good"" such intervention might be doing.  You know what they say about good intentions, after all.",t3_5gbkvq,DeviateFish_

Further complicating the matter would be how they subsequently handled the DAO on the ETC side, by choosing to do nothing, letting the attacker split away uncontested, and then rigging the refund contract to award themselves with any remaining ETC after a (short) time period.

ETC people aren't against the concept of returning funds - they have a problem with the way the funds were returned. To elaborate on your analogy - if the only way to return the bag to the lady was to murder the thief, does that make it ok to murder the thief? You are ignoring the cost associated with hard forking, as if there isn't one at all. What if you could call the police (WHG), but they only had a 80% chance of returning the funds? Does that justify murder? And no, I'm not literally equating the HF to murder, I'm building on your analogy. If it  was  so simple, please explain why we haven't hard forked for other smaller thefts or problems. Everyone (including Vitalik) agrees there wouldn't have been a hard fork if it was less than about 50M USD, so your position is not principled. If Gatecoin / keys stolen / funds lost in other buggy contracts / grandma sends life savings to null, was all ""okay"", why was TheDAO ""not okay"". The point was that a HF has a non-zero negative effect on the network. A lot of people using Ethereum had nothing to do with TheDAO and did not invest, yet they still had to bare that non-zero cost on behalf of the bailoutees. From our point of view, you used a tactial nuke to stop the thief, got the back the old lady's bag, but caused severe collateral damage to everyone else in the park.

A lot of people using Ethereum had nothing to do with TheDAO and did not invest Even if not invested they would have a lot with it if nothing was done, DAO Wars and a powerful bad actor with huge funds playing around with ETH and PoS used a tactial nuke to stop the thief Why tatical nuke?

These things aren't verifiable; it's all pointless bickering and speculation at this point. Because there's no empirically verifiable position, that's why we need to argue principles.

Yes the attacker is on the move again right now. He donated some ether into the DAO and joined one of the whitehat splits. We drained the ETH he donated as fast as we could but he got what he wanted. An attacker in now part of split 78 and he can now do the split attack again in that white hat DAO after 24 days. Keep in mind he controls a tiny minority of tokens so such an attack would not be really effective. Regardless this is why we need a soft fork. I will publish a blog post very soon with the steps forward from now on. But DO NOT panic. That means that any other move the attacker would try to do would come after 24 days.

That would bring up the possibility that the attacker planned ahead and placed himself on every existing DAO beforehand to be able to react to this kind of mitigation attempts.

In a crypto sense hard forking for such a big hopefully once in a lifetime event is like getting a bankwire back to bank it was stolen from- restoring most funds. This DAO hack is the same thing. Just like how DAO hacker used it's own code against DAO and the robber used banking transactions to move move, they both exploit mechanisms within each system- which makes it fraud.  Which is a weakness in the banks deposit process... but doesn't mean the people who were stolen from cant get there money back from the other bank does it>?? same applies here. We know where the ETH is the people deserve their ETH back while DAO figures there shit out. It's obvious the hacker could have possible criminal charges and civil lawsuits against him. He had malicious intent which negates any contract he was involved in even with a contract fraud is fraud.... Hacking a hack to hack more hacks is going to make this continue.

"This is an excellent paper. Thank you for taking the time and effort to work through this so carefully. To me, this illustrates the value of simplicity when designing this sort of system. Most of the problems come from the weird ""split"" mechanic, and its weird interactions with voting. If they just didn't have that mechanic at all, and instead allowed voters to directly withdraw their money at any time, there would be far fewer problems, and it would be much easier to analyze. (It also illustrates the value of not rushing this stuff out the door. Several of these problems were pointed out after Slock released the white paper, but for some reason were never addressed.)",t3_4lcito,peterborah
"Agreed about not rushing things, but I actually am a fan of complex protocols when the complexity is required to reach protocol guarantees (e.g. Casper). I actually think splitting is a really nice thing. A lot of these problems have nothing to do with splitting, actually.",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir
"Sometimes complexity is warranted. For instance, I don't think the EVM would be better with fewer opcodes. But in many cases complexity just makes it harder to analyze and obscures problems, as I believe is the case here. Maybe we have different definitions of words like ""a lot"" and ""most"", but of the seven attacks you outline, five of them are a direct result of the complicated relationship between splitting and voting. (Of the other two, one of them is due to a different bit of unnecessary complexity, the extraBalance. Majority takeover is the only one that seems inherent to the structure rather caused by extraneous complexity.) What value do you see splitting having over simple withdrawal?",t3_4lcito,peterborah
"Okay I should have said ""A lot of these problems exist because both  token transfers and splitting are blocked by voting."" Splitting is great because it lets people separate into their own DAOs based on shared interests. I don't think it would at all be a bad outcome, for example, if the DAO split into two parts, one which is willing to fund things with negative expected rewards (like public goods), and one which is not.",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir
"Are you guys looking into anything at Ethereum protocol level for funding public goods? I'd like to see a proportion of token inflation go into a multisig dev wallet as I'm assuming Ethereum will never be finished and will need constant upkeep. Inflation seems the fairest way of funding public goods as it hits token holders as opposed to users (shouldn't affect TX fees). The flip side is, holders then benefit from the public good projects as they increase the utility of the protocol and therefore the value of the token. Very much agree with a moratorium btw.",t3_4lcito,C1aranMurray
"I'd like to see a proportion of token inflation go into a multisig dev wallet as I'm assuming Ethereum will never be finished and will need constant upkeep I'm supportive of the principle, although I'd prefer to come up with a reasonably decentralized mechanism for doing it; I don't like the idea of a set of privileged actors called ""The Ethereum Foundation"" (or for that matter ""A Set Of Private Individuals who Happen to be Named Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, etc"") having a permanent position of power in the protocol. And those mechanisms are hard to find; democracies are vulnerable to bribe attacks, futarchies have the problem of determining the right metric, etc. I have some cool ideas around sunspot equilibria and N-of-N assurance contracts, which have the advantage that they may not actually require explicit issuance, but the effectiveness of those would be limited.",t3_4lcito,vbuterin
"Jesus, Vitalik I know I could look this up, but what in god's name is a sunspot equliibrium? Also you realise that Mercury transited last week?",t3_4lcito,Sunny_McJoyride
Yes agreed. The governance of it is certainly the tricky part. I suspect we'd require EU-style qualified majorities amongst voting token holders along with the approval of some other governance body. How one builds a robust separation of powers into a DAO though is something I have spent absolutely no time thinking about.,t3_4lcito,C1aranMurray
"We've looked at it. It is difficult because of cultural and legal reasons (cryptocurrency communities generally regard this kind of thing as a scam, and the legal status of this kind of income is unclear), and so isn't an option that's on the table right now. However, I really like the idea. Paying for public goods with issuance sounds good to me.",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir
Absolutely hear where you're coming from re cultural connotations. Hopefully the DAOfication of everything is shifting opinions on that now. I think it is tbh. I'm no lawyer but I thought the legal risks associated with inflation would be a lot less than those associated with a crowdsale.,t3_4lcito,C1aranMurray
"That's fair. And you're right that that problem would still be there if it were withdrawals rather than splits that were blocked. My point is more that it was harder to see these problems due to the complexity of splitting. Looking back at my posts after the release of the whitepaper, I was spending my time trying to figure out stuff like if the stalker attack would work, what the implications of 7 vs. 14 days of voting was, etc. A simpler system would have had a higher chance of seeing these issues caught. (Not that it would have mattered, since Slock didn't bother to fix the ones I  did  find.) I agree that forming more DAOs is good, but it seems like that would be better if it weren't part of the core algorithm. If you can withdraw your money, then you can also put it into a new DAO. There's a collective action problem maybe, but that's what smart contracts are good at solving.",t3_4lcito,peterborah
"Most of the problems come from the weird ""split"" mechanic, and its weird interactions with voting. If they just didn't have that mechanic at all, and instead allowed voters to directly withdraw their money at any time, there would be far fewer problems, and it would be much easier to analyze. Direct withdrawals works initially, but not after a while when there has been significant investments. Suppose 90% of the funds have been invested. A direct withdrawal would only give you 10% of the DAO value.",t3_4lcito,LarsPensjo
The same is true about a split.,t3_4lcito,peterborah
"If you participate in a split, you will get your portion of reward tokens. So it is still ok to do a split after 90% has been invested.",t3_4lcito,LarsPensjo
There's no reason a withdrawal couldn't also give you reward tokens.,t3_4lcito,peterborah
"Most of the problems come from the weird ""split"" mechanic, and its weird interactions with voting I agree...though you could design a ""DAO"" to have specific characteristics, ideally a DAO should be designed in such a way that all proposals are aligned with the DAO mission and is in the interest of most to all token holders.

"A++ Your response is brilliant. I will mull this over! I actually am very cautious about advocating changes to the voting system. I'm completely aware that I'm not an expert on the topic. I'm much more concerned about grace periods after voting ends, and withdrawal functions so people can leave at any time.",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir
"Thanks for sharing your insight. Even if you incorporate your comments into the voting system, you still need to resolve the main underlying problem, which is that the system cannot maximise the moral and economic utility functions at the same time. These two conflicting objectives could be described like this: A political or moral utility function is about maximising some form of individuals' right to decide, regardless of a any given individual knowledge or ability to decide. Observing moral values is the priority. In a democracy, everybody has the right to vote. An economical utility function is about maximising the quality of the decision process. Individual rights are irrelevant. In any complex decision making process, what is important is the quality of the opinions, that cannot be replaced by a larger number of unqualified opinions. You don't take a poll on the general population to decide on a medical treatment, you ask a team of doctors. This is, in my opinion, the fundamental flaw of a decentralised decision making process. Any complex problem requires expertise and expertise is centralised. We are all ignorants in almost everything except a narrow domain of specialization. Rights are evenly distributed among the population. Expertise is not. How do you reconcile this reality?. How do you select those opinions that are really valuable? No, the wisdom of the crowds is not a mechanism that works in complex decision process. It is just an application of the law of large numbers, an statistical artifact. It works in situations where there is large individual estimation error: in the example that we are all familiar with, it is difficult to estimate how many jelly beans there are in a jar, however anyone knows that is not zero and that is not one billion, but something in between. Humans have some estimation ability for this exercise, even if rough. Increasing the number of people reduces the variance of the sample and increases the quality of the mean as estimator. There is no magic, it is expected. Thus, for the wisdom of the crowds to work, you need wisdom in the crowd to begin with. It is not some sort of magic that creates knowledge out of nothing. That is why it does not work in any complex decision, where knowledge is not widespread. So, how can we have a sound decentralized decision process in a distributed environment? I don't know, but it seems to me that for any complex real life problem, it is difficult to avoid some degree of centralisation. That is why Vlad and Emin come up with a paper, because they know what they are talking about. In other words, a DAO will need to make a choice between maximising a political function or maximising an economic function. All the comments that I am seeing are intelligent solutions to optimize the political function, but what about the quality of the decisions? Cheers.",t3_4lcito,Si8Pa
"CC my comment on  the dao : Let me make one thing clear: as a curator  I do not support a  curator-led  moratorium  because I don't believe our job is to lead but to follow the token holders. As a token holder I would like to see an  experiments on child DAOs  that would hold a few million ether only and have these issues resolved. But as a curator, only thing I ask is: If you are a token holder, please start a self proposal tomorrow asking about the moratorium or vote in one if it's there . Whatever the token holders decide, I will support.",t3_4lcito,avsa
"Alex, It is a nice gesture of you to seek approval of the investors, before enacting such a radical change. However, I really hope that you will go ahead and enact the moratorium right away, preferably before the trading begins, for the following reasons: As the moratorium document states, the voting system can not be relied upon in the current form because of the affirmative yes bias. In this case, whoever will disagree with the collegial decision of Curators to enact moratorium can split away forming a new set of curators. The voting algorithm is designed to change the curators and send money to contracts. It is not designed to signal preferences about what curators should do. The voting results will be non-binding at best. A lot of investors might solo-split while the voting period is ongoing, because of the uncertainty. You might be able to better preserve the size of DAO the sooner you act. Although, I can see how eventually voting can be used for this kind of function, I don't think voting on this would be reasonable in this case. Lastly, what would be your plan of action if the voting results will be ""no""? Would you start whitelisting ordinary contracts right after the debate period is ended, despite having concerns about the system reliability?",t3_4lcito,CryptoDao
"+1, Well put I personally would support a moratorium even if the token holders disagreed. I'm going to try my best to reduce the uncertainty by the time markets open.",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir

If the DAO wants to start funding companies, then I would be extra careful by only whitelisting proposals that I felt if they passed would not compromise the whole system",t3_4lcito,avsa
"thank you so much Alex and Vlad. I am so relieved as I invested most of my ETH holdings in the DAO thinking it would be a better way for me to hold on to them so I could not trade them. I did this because of the withdrawal before voting guarantee. But all these issues are so worrisome, I fear for my investment and the people I told to invest in the DAO as well. Thank you both for writing this call to Moratorium and I hope this will be the first order of the day tomorrow when the DAO launches.",t3_4lcito,cointroll88
"+1, thanks Alex.",t3_4lcito,newretro
"I agree with this analysis. As the paper outlines, the Dao is open to various attacks in its current form, and thus cannot be relied upon to institute the necessary improvements through the proposal voting mechanism. One of the potential solutions outlined is a moratorium of proposals, followed by voluntary transfer of funds to an upgraded Dao.",t3_4lcito,agpennypacker
"Good points. Still, it's the only way we have for the DAO to express its opinion",t3_4lcito,avsa

"I agree with you. The only way to defend against a moratorium attack is to split/change the curator. Curators can partially influence or completely determine the order in and rate at which proposals can be made, depending on the relationship between whitelist addresses and proposals. If the DAO wants to spend money at a certain pre-determined rate, then the order and frequency of proposals will directly influence how much funding any particular proposal will receive. Today, the rate and order of proposals is not determined by the oracles, who do not act as a coordinated organization (although I'm trying to spur some coordination to stop proposals).",t3_4lcito,vladzamfir

"You really see it as a proof ? The Affirmative Bias, and the Disincentive to Vote No
The current DAO has a strong positive bias to vote YES on    
proposals and to suppress NO votes as a side-effect of the 
way in which it restricts users’ range of options following 
the casting of a vote. Specifically, the current DAO restricts 
the ability of a token holder to split from the DAO once they 
have voted on a proposal until the outcome of the vote is determined. 
Thus, a voter who believes a proposal has negative expected value 
is in a quandary: they can split from The DAO immediately without 
taking any risk, or else they can vote NO and hope that the proposal 
fails to be funded. A NO vote is therefore inherently risky for an investor 
who perceives the proposal to be -EV, in a way that voting YES is not for a +EV voter.

"Thanks for making such a strong argument. I'm just about totally convinced. The remaining doubt for me has to do with my not understanding what the finish line would look like for the Moratorium? How do we know when it's over and we can proceed? Are you anticipating that the curators would offer a joint proposal for security upgrades and then token holders could only end the Moratorium by voting yes on that package? Will there be a bunch of smaller, single-issue proposals contributed by anyone, not just the curators? Will the curators tell us when enough of the issues have been addressed? As I understand it (and I may NOT understand it!!) it seems like the answer is that the Moratorium can't be lifted until the curators agree that the security issues have been addressed adequately and they can then whitelist a proposal to lift the Moratorium. But I missed it if that is explicitly stated somewhere and I'd appreciate confirmation if that is the case. If it is, that's actually fine with me because it seems to essentially redistribute influence, at least at this early stage, among basically the same group of people that I trusted when I bought the Ethereum crowdsale. TBH, I'm not sure if that is a first step toward us looking more like a traditional corporation with the curators moving into the position of de facto board of directors. Would be ironic if successive DAO votes essentially prove that the crowd's wisdom amounts to understanding that the structures evolved by coprorations through years of competition are as good as it gets. That path could be a series of incremental steps that all looked right at the time. That said, I do believe the Moratorium with curator control does look right at this time.",t3_4lcito,LGuappo
"I wish you had posted this moratorium days before, instead of hours before theDao came out. I found out yesterday about theDao and read all I could about it, deliberately searching for good and bad news. The feedback and sentiment was overwhelmingly positive with the people who said they didn't like it were mostly speculating. With all the positive momentum I guessed that if even for a 24-48 hours it would skyrocket and my 100% investment would pay off. But just hours before the Dao went live your detailed analysis breaking down all the flaws appeared. And my heart sunk. On the one hand I knew this was a good thing for the Dao, on the other hand I never imagined bad news would be released just hours before, it did feel planned. But the message was so heartfelt and genuine, a plea to do better that I knew this was an opportunity, a chance for us to really make this a success. Now I am one with theDao, I am invested in theDao and my investment is at stake like the rest of everyone elses. I want to see it  succeed, I want to see these flaws amended, I want the best for theDao because theDao's success is OUR success and this was the greatest thing to happen because it allows us to fix our weaknesses and come out strong before any attacks happen. There is 11-12million at stake. We can't throw away that progress and move backwards, so let's move forwards. Thank you for posting your genuine heartfelt and detailed paper.

I want to hear criticisms, and alternative suggestions, so that I can modify something that works for us as a whole.

"As an  /r/bitcoin  - er let me say the following: People who participate in that sub are not blind followers of the moderators.  You cannot be disappointed with everyone involved in that sub simply because you are disappointed with the moderators. Most of the people I saw here from bitcoin, and I include myself, are strong advocates of the principles of immutability and strong opponents of forking, not for the benefit of bitcoin, but for the benefit of ethereum.  I also argued in favour of pursuing white hat attacks.  Bitcoiners' philosophy lined up 100% with your white hat hacker  /u/avsa , who also begins his post on what to do with the money on  /r/thedao   (  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4p0u7q/lets_talk_about_all_the_options_to_secure_recover/ ) with the quote: ""For the record, I'm strongly against doing any hard fork that breaks immutability or balances of contracts."" Those of us who came here to try to make the same principled argument were treated with quite a bit of hostility, but I don't care about that and don't care for an apology either.  I simply want to express my ideas and the reasons for them.  I did that. I've been labelled as someone who wanted to crash the price of ethereum, but that is absolutely not true in the least.  You'd have to believe that your white hat attacker has the same interests because he advocated for the exact same approach. There is still a very long road ahead for both bitcoin and ethereum.  Much has been discovered in the last week about further ethereum vulnerabilities in the solidity language.  Don't look at the trading price of the currencies (or tokens) as an indicator of everything being fine or not.  The world knows little of what's going on in crypto, and any evasion of a real issue to celebrate a high price will be short lived when the real issue is exploited.  I hope that lesson has been widely learned. I do not believe a war between bitcoin and ethereum makes any sense.  If one of them has a fundamentally flawed philosophy that will lead it to destruction, then that will happen not because of a war, but because of the dominant value proposition that the winner offers over the loser.  But there doesn't have to be one winner and one loser here.  Ethereum is newer, with less maturity and more functionality, and that newness combined with that functionality makes it vulnerable to what we have seen.  Priority one for ethereum is to fix what's vulnerable across the whole platform. Bitcoin is marching ahead with its answers to its issue for scaling and other off-chain functionality. Wasting time on a ""war"" is pointless.  For me, it's important to learn what's going on in both technologies.  Dogmatic adherence to whatever is argued on any side without fact checking is the only dangerous thing really.  If you want to be at war with something, be at war with lies and fight for the truth. Moderators don't speak for an entire community, especially when it is a community that has at its strongest core the principle of adherence to decentralization and censorship resistance.",t3_4p9emk,logical

Refer back to the religion analogy. You guys are acting like fundamentalist Christians. I simply want to express my ideas and the reasons for them. No one in ethereum needed  /r/bitcoin  to sell them the bitcoin ideology. We know. We are not bitcoin. Thanks. If one of them has a fundamentally flawed philosophy that will lead it to destruction It's not that dramatic. Ethereum is an ongoing experiment in its early stages. Wasting time on a ""war"" is pointless. Yes. For me, it's important to learn what's going on in both technologies. Showing up and shouting about your own personal ideological beliefs does not qualify as learning. Dogmatic adherence to whatever is argued on any side without fact checking is the only dangerous thing really You guys haven't fact checked anything.

"For one, I don't treat individuals as members of a generalized group. Not all Ethereum users are sock puppet users, rude, irrational, stalkers, makers of false accusations, etc...   A very vocal and seemingly hysterical few for sure have been behaving that way since this situation broke out. This is ethereum' first moment of truth.  Everything has been easy going until now. I couldn't give a f$&k about the moderators of a subReddit about it. My concern is in seeing how its ecosystem ultimately deals with this situation. The resilience of Bitcoin is amazing. With all that it has been through, it has demonstrated that it is very hard to kill.  This has not been true of the other alt coin experiments to date. At their best, they have shone brightly for a brief period and then burned out. The Dao was the first big Ethereum only project.  It was ill conceived and was bound to have scandal.  That only worsened when the amount of ether in it became so huge and the value of Ether climbed so much. How this ultimately gets dealt with will determine if Ethereum lives to move on to its second death (Bitcoin has died 183 times or something so far).  Most other coins stay dead after their first death (or basically on life support forever). With so much information flying around I think the biggest existential threat to Ethereum now has nothing directly to do with the Dao and whether or not the stolen ether in it is returned or not.  It has to do with atomicity in transactions.  Where a trade is taking place, all aspects of that trade need to take place in one multi signature blockchain transaction.  Not in two or more lines of solidity where each line hits a different block on the blockchain.  Without atomicity this problem and a whole family of similar problems will be too much a risk with any trade and would make the primary purpose of Ethereum impossible to achieve. That's the current problem. Moderators of this or other subreddits and how I feel about them are irrelevant. Note please that my reply was in defence of me as a bit coiner and not a defence of every individual who frequents  /r/bitcoin .",t3_4p9emk,logical
"Well thanks for the reply, but atomicity of transactions is at worst a language level problem, and that can be dealt with – given we're not going to see daos of anywhere near this size anytime soon, it's not a existential threat to ethereum, merely a serious threat – and no doubt future development will be necessarily slowed down. The actual existential threat in my opinion is the one that you have dismissed – I believe for ideological reasons – the existence of a malicious attacker who may yet obtain 14% of the eth supply.",t3_4p9emk,Sunny_McJoyride
"He'll at most get 30% of 14%.  That's less than 5% and he'll probably sell a lot of it so he won't have it long.  Not an existential threat.  The bugs in solidity, if not remedied, will allow him and others like him to take much more.  But it is merely the existence of these bugs that is the existential threat, because who would use ethereum for smart contracts, its main raison d'être, if such bugs existed?  Nobody but a patsy is who.",t3_4p9emk,logical
"I still have faith in the project. How are bugs that can be fixed be an existential problem? Unless you're saying ethereum is doomed because not all the bugs can be fixed or be discovered, in which case you've fundamentally given up on this project, and it's clear you should move onto another coin that you can believe in. Neither do we yet have an absolute guarantee that the funds in the other 70% are absolutely safe from the attacker, and other exploits may exist.",t3_4p9emk,Sunny_McJoyride

"Hey guys..I'll just leave this here: ""1/16/2016 - I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully. The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world). One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin. So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues. The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen. If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1 Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it. Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial. Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience). First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, ""If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?"", ""If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?"", ""If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?"". Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations. Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime. So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.""",t3_4p9emk,Kitten-Smuggler

"Just gotta say that uh... most of those points are actually true. Ethereum is centralized It is.  See: setting supporting the fork to be the default ^[1] ; setting default gas fees (that aren't diverged from) and setting recommendations for fees during spam attacks ^[2] ; colluding directly with exchanges to stop ETH trading hours after the DAO drain was discovered ^[3] ; and more. Vitalik is dangerous I don't think this one is particularly true.  He's naive and maybe slightly impulsive (see  [3]  above), but I don't think he's ""dangerous"", per se. ""Ethereum Classic"" is the original Ethereum. Well, technically it is, since a hard-fork is, by definition, a change in the consensus rules.  ETC opted out of that change, choosing instead to maintain the older rules variant. The DAO hack was not a big deal and was not viewed as a existential threat at the time. (revisionist history) It wasn't.  Neither Vlad ^[4]  nor Vitalik [citation needed]  considered the amount of stolen funds to be a threat to PoS. The Ethereum blockchain is no different than a centralized database because transactions are just rolled back willy nilly. Yeah, this one's pretty trash.  However, the grain of truth at the core is that the EF + miners + exchange ""cartel"" is basically the DBA of the system--provided sufficient incentive, they could indeed ""roll back"" (aka ""non-standard state change"") anything they wanted to, provided they make a big enough show of support for it. ""Ethereum Classic"" follows the law of code, not the law of man. If you believe the ""rule of law"" then you must select ETC. (These idiots do not understand the law of blockchains which are decentralized communities of humans.) I think you're misinterpreting this one.  I think it's referring to the whole ""code is law"" thing that people were abusing and twisting to try to support the fork.  ""Code is law"" was a phrase that basically meant: if you wrote a contract (""law""), the code enforced it.  If the code you wrote wasn't what you intended, well, too bad, because it's the representation of the ""law"", but you implemented it incorrectly.  The ""code is law"" could be rephrased ""contracts are law on the blockchain--and in the event of a dispute of interpretation, the code has the final say."" ""Ethereum Classic"" has control over the hearts, minds and behavior of all their community members to prevent any disagreement. Wat? Ethereum supply growth is unlimited. Technically true.  Ethereum's issuance rate is 5 ETH per block, with no caps, no reduction--only the PoW difficulty bomb to eventually slow the issuance, but not stop it.  The issuance decreases over time (at the cost of throughput), but isn't capped. ""Ethereum Classic"" follows Austrian economics while Ethereum does not. Roughly speaking, if ETC goes through with their issuances changes, this will be true. Proof of Stake is an ""insult"" to the mining community Absolutely 100% true.  A switch to Proof-of-stake represents a pretty big loss to any miners invested in mining ETH--because they won't be able to mine it anymore, and will have to switch to the next-most-profitable coin.  In some ways, it's basically a ""thanks, but we don't need you anymore"" and a boot out the door without so much as a parting gift. Charles Hoskinson is Ethereum's former CEO. True ^[5] ETC value will be more that ETH. Definitely wishful thinking. So... lots of that is actually true.  Whether or not you agree with it on a philosophical level doesn't affect how true it is. For what it's worth, even vitalik used to be against the idea of hard forks. ^[6]",t3_5kyuhr,DeviateFish_

"You've just described every collaborative open sourced project, guess what they all have - a central repository. Centralization is literally required for software development, the decentralization aspect is only important in terms of providing services. So then you agree, it's centralized. /s Seriously, though, the issue is that if the EF says jump, the miners and exchanges ask ""how high?""  The end users (or even nodes)--the ""democratic"" part of blockchain consensus--don't actually have a say in how things are run.  The EF wanted a fork, it got a fork--even if 50% of the nodes had voted against it, it would have happened.  Why?  Because they had the implicit support of the mining pools and exchanges. Had the EF just taken a stand and said ""we're hard forking, here's why,"" and not pretended to make it a democratic consensus, there would be far fewer issues around this.  The problem is that they made a show of entertaining the option of not forking, purely to continue to have the ability to say ""the community decided"". The reality is that > 80% of all stakeholders (miners/node operators/coin holders) didn't even vote.   In a blockchain consensus algorithm, not voting is (supposed to be) synonymous with voting for the status quo .  This is to provide security through inertia--by ensuring that defaults are always in favor of the status quo, you require the  active  participation of greater than half the network to enact a fork. By setting the defaults, the EF sets the ""status quo""--even when it's divergent from the actual status quo.  This comes at the cost of security, since it's now proven that Ethereum can fork at the whim of a highly-motivated minority.  They leveraged the inertia of apathetic votes to pass a fork that didn't have the  active participation  of the majority of  any  of the stakeholders. See  this thread  (and the one it links to) for even more details on this.",t3_5kyuhr,DeviateFish_
"As they should, they are the owners of the project. Yeah, that's not how that's been sold to the end users.  We always get told that we ""have a say"", when in reality, the only ones who do are exchanges and pool operators.  Everything that happens is at their whim--and if they're following the lead of the EF, that means literally the entire network is at the behest of the EF. That's pretty much the opposite of ""democratic"" or ""consensus-driven"". So, do you have a grassroots anti-fork movement to point to that had actually traction? I dunno, there seems to be an anti-fork movement with a chain that's worth ~10% of ETH.  Seems to have had some sort of traction. Who fucking cares that these idiots couldn't be bothered to decide on their future? You should.  If you can't understand the security implications of < 15% of the stakeholders of the network deciding the fate of the entire network, you don't understand the benefits a blockchain is supposed to provide.  The whole point of a consensus mechanism is to make it impossible for anything less than a majority to enact a change upon the network.  The developers are supposed to be the custodians of that--ensuring that only protocol upgrades are allowed by default.  By crossing the line into application territory, they're signaling that they're okay with tampering with the consensus protocol for the sake of things that aren't actually related to the consensus protocol. This means if a highly motivated minority gains the approval of the EF (or otherwise coerces them), they can fork the chain, regardless of how the majority feels (positive or negative). Stake holders can always refuse the update A bunch of them did.  That's how we ended up with ETC.

It's not a sure-fire case, it could be argued either way, but it's a completely different beast than if some random Joe off the street cloned the Dogecoin repository and slapped a label calling it ""Ethereum Supreme"". Also, the Foundation could clear up all legal concerns completely by issuing a statement that they were granting permission to use the trademark ""Ethereum"" to describe Ethereum Classic.

"Assassination market An assassination market is a prediction market where any party can place a bet (using anonymous electronic money and pseudonymous remailers) on the date of death of a given individual, and collect a payoff if they ""guess"" the date accurately.

Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the action of the assassin, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination.

A soft fork with a clever one way whitelisting mechanism + a draconian accounting system (which the Robin group has already mostly done) could recover nearly or up to 100% of the DAO funds (over many, many months of course). That said, a hard fork still stays (IMHO) the simplest, fastest , safest way forward, in the sense that both the soft and hard fork share many of the same attributes (they both require a code upgrade, and the 'hard fork' only affects the relevant transactions). So one wonders the utility of going through all the trouble and risk when the application is nearly identical and it could be all over in the course of a couple of weeks.

"I'm curious why the attacker would have done it this way. Was there some advantage (greater anonymity perhaps?) to running this attack through someone else's split proposal? Otherwise, seems like an unnecessary compromise of his ability to control his own fate. Maybe the guy really didn't plan very well?",t3_4p7mhc,LGuappo
"The fact that he may not have planned well has indeed been theorized because if this. It's hard to know for certain. There are some guys (jo, roman) who have put together a diagram of all the accounts and how they relate to one another. This is my personal theory on the original attacker. He never expected to get the ETH out. He opened a short, attacked, and closed when VB's blog post. Regardless of what you think about that blog, I have no doubt that if the entire team hadn't been so quick to react and forumulate a plan and make a decisive decision, much more could have been taken. We know a few contract addresses of the attacker and we know they voted on proposals before and after the infamous proposal 59. If you remember, the ETH hit $20 the morning of the attack. This is one good way to ensure a very profitable short. We don't know where the top would be but we do know that we would undoubtedly see a huge correction from $20 at some point. So. The attacker is on his testnet. He successful attacks his own dao. Now what? He knows that if he's done it others aren't far behind. We know the ETH price is up. For a split proposal to mature, it takes 7 days. Does he want to wait 7 days? No. Him and his contract pals vote on all the splits and wait until a split closes where he is the only party who voted yes. Then his attack begins. He could have waited a day. Or 3 days. Or 6 days. He may have opened his own splits but found a suitable one beforehand. It's hard to know. As long as he was the only one to vote yes, he knew he was alone. And if he never expected to keep the ETH, then it doesn't matter anyways.",t3_4p7mhc,insomniasexx
"Probably the latter.  It takes 7 days to propose a split and become curator.  I assume they did not want to wait that long.

"If we know the curator of the Attacker DAO and (s)he agrees to cooperate, we can change the curator to a multisig so that the original curator doesn't control anymore the Attacker DAO (just in case the ""innocent curator"" was just a social engineering trick by the attacker). Then we can whitelist the withdrawal contract and make a proposal to send all the funds to it. If we don't control enough tokens to approve the proposal, we can proceed by smaller incremental transfers to reduce the quorum size or even vote for a smaller quorum via the curator. Of course the attacker could also oppose to the proposal. To prevent that we can create more tokens in the Attacker DAO using the technique described in the article  ""a DAO counter attack"" . The only way the attacker could prevent us from withdrawing all the funds from the Attacker DAO would be to split into yet another child DAO and start another attack but then we could join his split and do the same on his new DAO and/or create our own split and attack the Attacker DAO to drain some funds too. This is an endless game but the attacker knows we are not letting him get away with the loot no matter what so keep playing the game is a losing proposition for him as he will just waste time and gain nothing out of it ... unless... his real intent is (and perhaps always was) to push Ethereum to fork. Forcing a cryptocurrency into betraying its own core principles and corrupting its own integrity could be one of the most effective way of discrediting it and getting rid of it in the long run. We can't exclude that this was the attacker's motivation. One more reason to put any fork on hold now that we are sure that the attacker can't withdraw the funds.",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion
"/u/LefterisJP ,  /u/avsa ,  /u/vbuterin : I think there is a way to withdraw all the funds without even a soft fork or force the attacker to negociate, see parent post. Am I missing something?",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion
When the curator approached us we thought of something similar but unfortunately this can not work. Let me explain why: The curator had not voted on his own split. So he does not have any tokens in the Dark DAO.  He only can control the dark DAO whitelist and/or halve minQuorum. In order to gain majority over the attacker we need to put in more than he has in there. That's more than 3.5 mil ether. It's a lot. The  counter-attack  method as described in the post unfortunately can't use the exploit. It can only buy by using actual ether. No matter how much we put in the Dark DAO the attacker can always split out again using the exploit. Due to the above the only solution to actually taking the money out of the dark DAO with the biggest chance of success is a targetted soft-fork which would reject all value transfers to DAOs except for one approved account. That approved account would be the recipient of the  createTokenProxy()  of the counter attack scenario and would be able to perform the counter attack again on the child DAO. It's a lengthy process but it has a small chance of working. Better and cleaner solution is always a hard-fork. But I am not gonna open this debate here. What I want people to understand is that unfortunately if no soft-fork is put in place anyone can do this again in the child DAOs and keep the game up ad-infinitum. I am sure this is a scenario none of us wants to see happening.,t3_4p7mhc,LefterisJP
"Yes, we can get all the funds back with soft forks now. How do you feel about that (I know you were against the hard fork)?",t3_4p7mhc,BGoodej
"I am against all sorts of forks. Now that we have a way to recover the funds without  any fork at all  and in the very worst case make sure that the attacker can never withdraw which means that he will eventually give up or accept to negociate, I don't see any justification to rush a fork now.",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion

There is now way to block the attacker from withdrawing without a soft fork.,t3_4p7mhc,BGoodej
"The attacker can never withdraw the funds if we keep stalkimg and draining all his child DAOs before maturity and we can never withdraw either if he does the same to our child DAOs. The first camp who doesn't retaliate within the maturation time loses the game. Not saying that this is ideal. It's laborious, costly and postpones the release of the funds to an indeterminate date but it allows to buy time to consider our options. Since the game is a hassle for both sides the attacker will probably want to negociate.",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion
"There's a notion of speed to the draining. The more tokens you have in the target DAO, the faster you can drain. The attacker has 35M Ether worth of tokens bought at 1:100 in the darkDAO. I think your plan would require us to move ALL the recovered fund into his darkDAO to drain faster than him. Also, if we buy into hos darkDAO, it can only be with a proposal i TheDAO:  2 weeks debating means we will be buying at a ratio superior to 1:100 and be losing funds and draining power to the darkDAO extra balance",t3_4p7mhc,BGoodej
"I agree that we wouldn't be able to drain the ETH very fast but the fact we are attacking would still force him to move his funds to another child DAO and wait another 30 days to have a chance to withdraw them. And if we stalk him by following him everywhere and always attack a few days before maturity in such a way that he is obliged to migrate again, his funds are effectively stuck forever in the system until he gives up or accepts to negociate.",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion
"This might be really long though, long enough to deter us to do that. I guess it depends on the amount we send to drain. He also might create a lot of splits to make things even harder to manage.

"The code of children DAO is the same as the code of The DAO which, if what was advertized is correct, allows us to appoint one or several curators, remove curators, add curators etc. In the worse case if single-sig vs multi-sig is a once-in-a-lifetime choice we should still be able to replace the current curator by one the community trusts otherwise that would mean that the DAO would die with it's one and only benevolent-curator-for-life which would be absurd.",t3_4p7mhc,TaleRecursion
"There were many confused explanations back then. Truth is, you can only fire the DAO curator by splitting from it. If curator is already a contract involving multiple parties, they can add and remove (Gavin) the parties according to contract rules.

The extrabalance can be recovered just by voting to send it somewhere. Why do you think we need to send funds back in TheDAO for that? The extrabalance is safe. Only thing is the current softfork might lock it down.,t3_4p7mhc,BGoodej
"Why do you think we need to send funds back in TheDAO for that? ExtraBalance can only be sent to TheDAO, because it was set-up that way: extraBalance = new ManagedAccount(address(this), true);

"There are even influent people around who spread things like ""formal verification isn't an absolute solution for security"". (If a mathematical proof isn't, what else do you want?) Yes, because it's true. Formal verification is important and great, but it is not an ""absolute solution""; nothing is. To understand why, read and deeply understand this:  https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value A mathematical proof is only useful if you know what to prove, and just figuring out how to express this is a challenge. Often, the desired security properties for an application are just as complex as the application itself, and there are even quite often cases where the only logical way to specify what the program should be doing basically is to write something in the formal verification language that's isomorphic to the original code. Mathematically checking equivalence between two implementations, and mathematically checking that certain invariants are satisfied by a program, are both really great things, but there is  always  a risk you make the same mistake twice, or make a mistake in the code and fail to specify an invariant and the two mistakes coincide with each other. I am a huge proponent of ""formal verification"". I am an opponent of using the language of ""proving things correct"", because ""correct"" is a subjective human concept and there is always the (very large) risk of an oversight in the process of attempting to specify what you mean by this in code; I prefer the language of ""proving invariants"" or ""proving safety properties"". Fortunately though, multisig wallets are one of those cases where the key security property (need >=M users in an M-of-N wallet to send a transaction to perform a transaction from the wallet) actually can be specified pretty concisely, so I would  highly  encourage efforts to prove such a property for the various multisigs available today.",t3_7bdm1g,vbuterin

"You’re addressing the argument “formal verification solves all problems”, which, once again: no serious proponent of formal verification defends. What we say is: “formal verification is as good as it gets”, and that’s my problem with your argument, you’re essentially putting words in “our” mouth. You also argue that the specification can be complex and have mistakes. That’s true and, again, nobody disagrees nor says otherwise. But if the specification is wrong, then your project is obviously doomed; nothing else can save it, other than being more careful with the specification. If the specification is correct, though, then a formal proof guarantees the implementation also is; you can’t get much better than that, which is pretty much the point. Finally, the “specifications can be complex” argument is common and oversees the fact that a huge amount of things can, indeed, be specified simply. I invite you to think about all the multi millionaire hacks/thefts we had and answer which could be easily avoided with very simple theorems. The DAO (simple zero-sum theorem), parity multisigs (as you just said), eth-js private key paddings (simple correspondence), all of those would never have happened.

"You are both wrong.  Having no code is ""as good as it gets"" for security.  :) Trolling aside, all of these things from formal verification, audits, working with a constricted language, keeping feature set small, and even good coding practices (in some cases) slow down development.  You can choose to build a product that people actually want to use and make sacrifices of perfection along the way, or you can achieve perfection and effectively release nothing of interest because by the time you do 100 other people have already released the same thing. Note: This is coming from someone that is almost  always  arguing on the side of ""do it right"" over ""do it fast"", but in the end you have to trust engineers to make the call on what level of quality is ""good enough"" for the project being worked on.  No matter what they choose they will almost always choose wrong, because everything is terrible.  :) I bring this up in this thread in particular because formal verification is one of those things that is  incredibly  expensive (engineering time) relative to a lot of other things like good coding practices (which more often than not increases velocity) or cutting features.

Lack of time or motivation will probably always be at the forefront of why code goes wrong. This is why automation that makes devs' jobs easier is such a big win. A problem with most of the current state of formal verification, is that it takes too much overhead, so it's simply too much of a pain in the ass to use. But if you want the same level of reliability achieved through manual code reviews, I suspect it'll take much more effort.

If someone  can  come up with an easy way to turn human thought into formal verification then I think it would have significant value.  I think having a really strict language can help and isn't  too  high of a cost for engineering.  In particular better type constraints that can be used by a static analyzer to ensure that you don't invalidate any assumptions.  e.g., ""this is a number between 1 and 5"" rather than ""int"".

Formal verification covers so much ground in terms of secure contracts, that unit testing, good coding practice, audit etc are just subcategories of formal verification. For formal verification, you NEED to do a LOT more things than unit testing. You need great coding practices (because without having a fully understood model of your code, you can't prove it). Formal verification in itself is one of the most rigorous audits you can imagine, and formal verification forces your contract to be simple as possible. If you're the only developer working on a code, then you can't write a better unit test, have better coding practices, write simpler programs as much as you can, as you would with formal verification. Unit tests, audits, coding practices, architecture can only be improved if other people start doing it.

"Well, if by ""expressivity issues"" you mean inability to express a hacked together multi-sig wallet which freezes everyone's funds in one go, then yes, it has ""issues"". :) On a more serious note, it's not clear whether you even need ""persistence of state"" within the computation model. Any stateful computation can be expressed as  P(S1, S0, W)  where  S1  is new state commitment,  S0  is old state commitment and  W  is a witness. Predicate  P  checks whether S1 is consistent with S0 when given a witness  W . So predicate which is itself a pure function CAN be used to manage state. And on a blockchain, you want to put as little burden on the nodes as possible. Of course, it might be problematic to write programs in this way (although it's not really that problematic), you might use some high-level language which will write predicate  and  state management code for you. I'm not 100% convinced that Simplicity's programming model is the way to go, but at least it's worth considering. As for EVM, we know it sucks. But this might be a case of ""worse is better"": EVM is easier to start with when you don't have good tooling. So people can start writing contracts. Many of them will fail, but some will survive. On loops in Simplicity: Bounded loops, such as the 64 rounds needed by our SHA-256 implementation, can be achieved by unrolling the loop. Because of sub-expression sharing, this doesn’t unreasonably impact program size. We do not directly write Simplicity, rather we use functions written in Coq or Haskell to generate Simplicity. These languages do support recursion and we use loops in these meta-languages to generate unrolled loops in Simplicity. So I don't think it's an issue. Quite likely in all practically useful and meaningful contracts computations are always O(N) of data size, so it doesn't matter.",t3_7bdm1g,killerstorm
"Could you please elaborate on how you’d, for example,  write a counter on Scrypt ? That is, a contract that just counts how many times it was called (and how other contracts could query the current count). All that you said looks correct, but irrelevant.

"Could you please elaborate on how you’d, for example, write a counter on Scrypt? That is, a contract that just counts how many times it was called (and how other contracts could query the current count). This isn't a contract, this is a stateful object or a database. If you are building a database, then yes, you need persistence. But are you? The purpose of smart contract is usually to control funds. On Ethereum you can build a stateful multi-sig contract: it will accept signatures from Alice, Bob and Claire and unlock funds. On Bitcoin, same has to be achieved using a single transaction which has a proof that Alice, Bob and Clair signed it. You don't need state to count signatures. This model requires some form of communication between Alice, Bob and Clair, but usually communication is much cheaper and easier to implement that blockchain, so this isn't a problem. In a long run Bitcoin model is better. Same thing with a counter: you don't need a stateful counter on chain. If you are implementing a contract which unlocks something after counter reaches 5, then, maybe, instead of recording count on-chain you just send a proof that counter reached 5. Makes sense? If you absolutely want state on-chain, you can do it using covenants. You can't do it in a vanilla Script which only has access to scriptPubKey and scriptSig. If you expose more transaction data to it, then it's doable. The transaction X of a contract still needs proof of its state after transaction X-1. Specifically: how do you read the “old state commitment”. How can you have that without sstore? You can do that without ""sstore"" within Peter Todd's ""single-use seal"" model (which is related to Script only philisophically.) Nodes only need state to remember sealed outputs, i.e. something like 32 bytes per seal. They don't need to remember state. But implementing cryptocurrency on top of this is quite convoluted, I'm not sure I understand it... Obviously, it's hard to implement a system using  only  predicates. Obviously, you need to combine predicates with something which feeds them data. E.g. you might have an UTXO in form of  (predicated_commitment, state_commitment)  tuple. Maybe just  predicate_commitment . And yes, unrolling loops is absolutely an issue, are you proposing every transaction must occupy space proportional to the amount of computation it performs? Well, why not? Can you show me practical cases in which this would be an issue? Also paper seems to say that space might be smaller because of sharing, but I'm not sure how it works. And you can still express buggy things on scrypt the same, not sure why you would assume not having loops magically fixes a programmer’s buggy code... Well, maybe because multi-sig contracts are flawless on Bitcoin blockchain, but the top Ethereum company was unable to implement a working mutli-sig contract on Ethereum. in fact this paper is exactly about solving that, so not sure what you’re into... Nobody says that Script is perfect. But it's definitely less error-prone that Ethereum programming model.",t3_7bdm1g,killerstorm

"On (1), I hold the opinion that theorem proving is not difficult at all, and is only artificially made so by its community, due to a lot of academic jargon (and, sometimes, just because). I wouldn't agree with that at all. Formal verification requires techniques and domain knowledge most programmers are not exposed to as along with coding you now have to become an expert at writing program specifications and mathematical proofs. Consider how people moving from something like Java to Haskell complain that Haskell is too complex and the type system is confusing; formal verification is probably at least a 100 times jump in complexity more than this. Researchers have been trying for decades to make theorem proving easy enough to go mainstream and it's not a simple problem at all.

"Check out things like SPARK. https://www.adacore.com/sparkpro When software failure is unacceptable, ultra-high reliability can be attained at the same level of effort as traditional testing-based methods.

It also helps reduce delivery costs and timescales. The SPARK language and tools have a proven track record in the most demanding safety-critical and high-security systems. They are easily learned by software professionals and do not require a background in formal methods. Experience in projects such as Tokeneer shows that formal methods can achieve ultra-high reliability in a cost-effective manner. Formal methods engineering is possible without learning the theoretical background of French theorem provers... You're right that it's not a simple problem! But it's also not completely intractable.

"On (2), it is also another fact that most functional programming languages operate on very abstract/high levels, and that makes them unpractical to work as 1. the backbone of a rendering engine (because of performance), 2. inside environments like the EVM (because of gas costs). Completely disagree with you there. Gas costs are artificial costs, not true costs. Costs for functional programming on EVM can be the same as they are now, provided we're willing to break/split the EVM instruction set contract from what it is now (if needed). But at that point the cost is justified based on the fact that we shouldn't be defending bad architectural decisions anyways.

"I'm not arguing against formal verification at all, but this latest Parity bug is a great example of why it's not a complete solution. The code for the party contract was actually fine. Only the owner of the contract was allowed to kill it, and any formal verification process would have confirmed that. The problem is that the contract was deployed without being initialized, meaning the ""owner"" was open for the taking. The problem here was mostly an operational one; in order for this code to be secure it needed to be initialized. Any formal verification either would have assumed that the contract was initialized, or stated what the programmers already knew - that the contract needed to be initialized to be secure. That doesn't prevent the risk that operational errors are made and a contract that is capable of being secured doesn't get initialized properly. There was another case like this a while back. I don't remember the specifics, but some ICO had deployed an ICO contract that had been rigorously audited. Unfortunately, in the deployment process their javascript deployment tool had  0xsomeaddress  instead of  ""0xsomeaddress"" . Javascript interpreted the address as a number, since it started with 0x, didn't have sufficient precision to represent the whole address correctly, and deployed it incorrectly. No amount of verification of the contract would have caught the problems with the contract initialization.

Great question. Other nodes can witness an attack.. and then they..?  I believe the answer is bitch on Twitter but kinda hoping for more.,t3_8n58lv,HardlyD
The point is you’re not suppose to be able to do something about the 51% attack if they are the 51% that means they are the majority and the protocol should uphold the decisions of the majority. The only way to prevent this is to implement good game theory to evenly distribute and decentralize. Not to enact bailout plans.,t3_8n58lv,nulsec123
"This. Make sure beforehand you have everything ready to make it impossible for someone to own 51% of the consensus. That's also why PoS is better: you can't forbid someone to discretely buy more hash power, but you can definitely refuse to sell your own ETH or you can even buy some and stake more in case you see people buying too many ETH and endangering its distribution (even more so when buying more ETH makes it even more expensive to buy a bit more).",t3_8n58lv,Perleflamme
"Having a majority of hashing power and being ""the majority"" are two different things. A 51% attack is a centralized self-interested actor manipulating the blockchain for their benefit. It is not a majority acting on their own behalf. Don't conflate the two.",t3_8n58lv,PatrickOBTC
But their decisions should be upheld if they have 51% otherwise what’s the point of consensus,t3_8n58lv,nulsec123
there was talk about speeding up casper deployment in the context of the new asics if it were to become a problem,t3_8n58lv,RealFluffyCat
"If there’s a 51% “attack” that means they are the majority consensus. Therefore we should follow the blocks they produce. If there’s a 51% attack and the 49% are able to defend against it that would be the real failure in the protocol. Can you imagine if 51% of the actors are good but the 49% who are malicious gets to decide what happens to the blocks. The only way to prevent these “attacks” is to decentralize and distribute stop focusing on immediate plans of actions, the ledger should be immutable and align with the view of the majority (51% and up). Focus on creating good game theory and not bail out plans.",t3_8n58lv,nulsec123

Currently studying up on the details of Ethereum, but the general idea of ""smart contracts"" is what sold me on investing in this over Bitcoin.

How come Navcoin boasts 1120 transactions per second when ethereum is at 15? I understand navcoin is not that heavily loaded so it's not really being stressed at 1120 tps and the blocks aren't full.

Is it because nav is new and most nodes are owned by the dev team allowing them to run powerful hardware that can handle the block size?

"Mining is currently possible with high-end graphics cards, but I wouldn't recommend starting it now as Ethereum will move to different consensus mechanism not based on Proof of Work (""mining""), but on Proof of Stake (basically allocating some amount of collateral in form of ether to smart contract and receiving ""dividends"" on validating the transactions). This transition will start as early as 2018 Q1. Google Casper Proof of Stake or Ethereum road map. Google ledger nano s (or Trezor) hardware wallets",t3_77gytn,marci003
"From my research, you can use your credit card to buy on Coinbase; how do you sell? I am looking to invest maybe 100 or so dollars into Ethereum or Litecoin. Can someone explain to me a little more about the process?",t3_77gytn,bulldogwill
"From what I understand, best is to register your bank account on coinbase, so you can pay lower fees. then buy the currency you want. Then if you need to send it or exchange it use an exchange like GDAX (which is owned by coinbase) or Binance. Moving crypto to GDAX is fees free. Once you have the currencies you want in your portfolio move them to a safe wallet, an hardware like the Trezor or you can use myetherwallet",t3_77gytn,pp3355

"You can also convert to fiat and sell on Coinbase, assuming the ETH is available in your wallet.

What happened to the white hat stolen funds in ETC?,t3_4ukefq,[deleted]
"All 7.2M ETC are still  there . But remember we know there exists a new attacker within this childDAO who has come out (with a valid sig, proving the message was authentic) and said he won't let the white hats withdraw (the new attacker can do this using perpetual stalking attacks). So unless a deal is reached with the stalker, the ETC won't be rescued on the unforked chain. It should be noted that if the white hats do nothing, then the stalker will be able to get away with the 7.2 million ETC (though it'll take several weeks). The big question is whether it's worth spending valuable developer hours blocking the stalker from withdrawing those ETC, or spending days/weeks trying to negotiate with him/her. This whole thing gets rather complicated, because really the white hats have already gone above the call of duty trying to save the Ether in theDAO prior to the fork. They don't have any responsibility to the community that stayed with the unforked chain, although some of the white hats may still choose to take it on anyways out of a sense of community altruism, since the ETC have a non-trivial value (for now).",t3_4ukefq,commonreallynow

ETC is compromised by the stolen funds ETH is compromised by a breach of contract and by breaking the ultimate promise it itself had made. Can you pls get into your head that some people see the situation just like that and that they have every right to see it like that as that contract was indeed breached and that promise was indeed broken.

"I don't invest in things I don't understand or that have no fundamental value in my eyes. I believe the only reason ETC has value is because Poloniex enabled people to trade it and it was previously worth ~$20 before the fork so under $1 seems like great value when ETH is ~$13... I've seen videos of people boasting / pumping about how they've bought ETC and how they're investing in it as a lottery ticket or hedge... all of which only confirms to me that it's not got a bright future. In my mind, the price is dictating ETCs value, nothing else... people are effectively gambling that over time, enough developers & miners will switch to ETC to make it viable and give it true value in the long term. I don't see how or why that would happen given that the foundation and miners have declared support for ETH. Contrary to what you believe, I also think the general public would be more interested in using and supporting a cryptocurrency that has shown itself to have some sort of moral backbone and that has prevented a heist.",t3_4ukefq,jesusthatsgreat
"There is absolutely no difference between the technology involved in ETH and the technology involved in ETC. At the end we dont care how greedy are the investors... If one chain is more popular then its likely to be the one adopted, that s it. ETC is interesting right now because the coin is cheap and the difficulty lower but there is also the political incentive.

"some people didnt like at all that 5% of the holders can decide to hardfork the fuck of their money some people  meaning a single individual hacker? because up until Poloniex decided to trade ETC, he was the only person impacted negatively (in financial terms at least) by the hard fork... and even then you could argue the ether wasn't owned by him as it hadn't been released / contract hadn't been executed...",t3_4ukefq,jesusthatsgreat
So you absolutely can't understand that some may feel unsecure when they invest money into a platform that they think immutable and suddenly realise it's not? :) these people are the common ETH holders who indeed dont loose money but trust.

The only ones with the power to prevent that (aka the curators) didn't see fit to hand that responsibility off to anyone on that ETC side to block it with splits and such. The irony is that it's win/win for the attacker now.  As a contingency in the event the forked chain became dominant, all he had to do was stock up on DAO while it was selling for < 1 ETH per 100 DAO--which carries the added bonus that it can be dumped without market slippage and be untraceable.

I consider it very unlikely that the DAO attacker would have invested into tokens on any large scale before the hardfork. That would have registered somewhere.",t3_4ukefq,seweso
"How low did the ETH/DAO pair drop just after the drain? Where did it sit for weeks in the aftermath? How much volume has there been on that pair since the drain? How would you detect his exit (via the refund contract) among all the other whales exiting?

This is all assuming ETC continues to trade at a non-trivial price.",t3_4ukefq,severact
"So what was the hardfork for? And does that mean that after hardfork, the amount of currency just doubled just like that?",t3_4ukefq,abedfilms
"The hard fork was basically the Ethereum community taking its ball and going home, to its own chain where the stolen money was un-stolen. That worked, and DAO holders have their tokens back. But it seems they've somehow, for nontechnical reasons, failed to make sure that all the socially constructed value came along with them to the new chain. Some people still value the old chain for some reason, and now The Hacker is going to be able to cash in on some of that value--and there's nothing that the people who were stolen from can do about it. In fact, if we accept the notion that what The Hacker has is ETC, this new token, and not at all the same ETH asset as was stolen and returned, it's not clear to me whether what The Hacker is going to be cashing out is stolen property, or just an idiosyncratically-initially-distributed new asset or a bug bounty token.",t3_4ukefq,interfect
Some people still value the old chain for some reason Some reason = immutability (I own neither ETH nor ETC),t3_4ukefq,PotatoBadger
"I don't get it, if everyone has their tokens back on DAO/eth on the new chain, and everything stolen was reversed.. But then how is there all of a sudden extra currency in the form of ETC? If $100 worth of DAO existed, then a hacker stole $40, leaving $60, then a hardfork reset everything and DAO has $100 again, then on the unforked chain there's still $100 worth of ETC? (well the value may have gone down...) Is that right? How does that work.. Can't we hardfork 50 times and make 50 chains and 50x the value of all these ETH versions? I know this is overly exaggerated, but you get my point.",t3_4ukefq,abedfilms
"The extra currency is just a new name given to the original currency (without the change in the rules where the theft was reversed). If $100 worth of DAO existed, then a hacker stole $40, leaving $60, then a hardfork reset everything and DAO has $100 again, then on the unforked chain there's still $100 worth of ETC? (well the value may have gone down...) Is that right? How does that work.. It works basically by defining things right. The unforked chain is a different chain that branches off right before the movement of the stolen funds, and so of course on that chain loads of people hold tokens (including the DAO attacker, who has been busy moving them). Can't we hardfork 50 times and make 50 chains and 50x the value of all these ETH versions? Nobody knows! Isn't this exciting? Intuition says we can't do it 50 times, but it seems we can indeed do it once.",t3_4ukefq,interfect
"$100 worth of DAO existed then a hardfork reset everything and DAO has $100 again No, it has the amount of ether (as ETH) that used to be valued at $100. That same amount of ether also exists as ETC. The value of any of this ether is whatever the market will pay for it at that moment in time. ETH has basically split into two parallel universes, one where nothing changed and one where the ""stolen"" ether magically moved back to the DAO. Whoever controlled a given amount of ether at the time of the split (aside from the ""stolen"" ether) now has access to it in both universes. If you had ether on address A before the split, you can choose in universe ETH to move it to address B, and in universe ETC you can instead move it to address C. Ether in one universe cannot directly affect the ether in the other universe*, as they are now on separate blockchains. Now, consider the case where the market considers ether to have equal value in both universes, 1 ETH = 1 ETC. This means the fork has instantly doubled the amount of ether in every wallet and therefore halved the value of a unit of ether. Where you would have once paid someone X ether, now they would want you to pay X ether in ETH and X ether in ETC, or 2X ether total. (This is all before market fluctuations.) Of course, the reality is much more complicated and nobody can agree how much value ETH or ETC should have. Some people assign all the former value to ETH and consider ETC worthless, some assign all the former value to ETC, some distribute it between the two. And in all the chaos, the market value of ETH+ETC is dropping as people lose faith in both currencies. Can't we hardfork 50 times and make 50 chains and 50x the value of all these ETH versions? I know this is overly exaggerated, but you get my point. The only way for hardforking to increase the overall value (from what it would have been without a hardfork) would be if the market decides ETH is more valuable as two currencies instead of one. Even if the value of ETH+ETC goes up after this, you would have to predict what the non-hardfork value of ETH would be at that time in order to compare it. That being said, I seriously doubt  another  hardfork would increase the value, at least in the near future. *Unfortunately due to a very short-sighted decision, transactions in one universe can be selectively replayed in the other universe by anyone, leading to  all sorts of amazing problems , but that's a whole other mess.",t3_4ukefq,Kapow751
"The hardfork created two separate crypto-currencies; or maybe you can say it added one cryptocurrency (ETC).

I think I was speaking more generally to people who blame the Ethereum Classic supporters as if they are some how responsible for the DAO debacle when in fact they want nothing to do with any of it and most of them want to get down to the real business of building a blockchain for the very purposes you are interested in. The greedy politics comes from guys like Stephen Tual who went from working at VISA to building an obvious boiler room scheme on top of Ethereum. It doesn't matter how it was advertised, that's what it really was. It's unfortunate that the DAO attacker drained the DAO because they just beat a more complicated scam out of separating people from their money over a longer period of time, and we would have learned much more from that then we did from a poorly written send function.

The problem in smart contract adoption is not the smart contract per se, its just that the mass market has not caught up to the idea of cryptoes.

Company A and B engage escrow company C, and what to follows are a lengthy paper contract/agreement, and transfer of funds (usually substantial) from A to C and ideally to B. With smart contract all these are done more efficiently. The catch: A, B and C will need to be familiar with cryptoes, i.e. Maintaining wallet, private keys, etc. So for escrow the challenge is not so much in the technology, and more to user adoption, specifically adoption of cryptoes. In that sense (and this is why I personally think it is moot point to discuss whether BTC, ETH or ETC is better), any advancements in cryptoes is actually beneficial to all communities.",t3_4ukefq,darvink

The best way to get a handle on these is to outline project goals with timelines and then give periodic status reports.

I like the idea of burning it. I saw the attack happening so I did the logical thing and dumped my DAO on the exchange for less than what I paid for them. By refunding DAO holders you are stealing from people like me who did the right thing.,t3_4rbgyt,crytpomaniac

I just hate the inhumanity of a lot of anti-forkers. Very black/white. They act very smug and unconcerned about a theft that could be reversed. Yes, they have valid concerns but there's no need to be a dick. I personally don't see how not forking at all would prevent a government effort from forcing miners to fork in the future. The main question is whether government can or cannot force a fork. You could let thousands of houses burn down by not forking to avoid a precedent. If the government can force a fork, and wants to, it will.",t3_4oxo87,Phroneo

"If a soft fork is ok, why is the hard fork not ok? Because a soft fork does not require any modification of the protocol and can be simply the result on an informal agreement of the majority of the mining nodes. Such agreement could later be formalized into the protocol itself, but that step is technically unnecessary for the soft fork to happen and to be formally valid. In fact, a soft fork can happen at any time, for any reason. You could even say that the whole blockchain algorithm is based on the fact that the equivalent of soft forking keeps happening every time a new block is found and there is a constant consensus mechanism to agree on which fork is currently considered the valid one. You could see a soft fork as people still playing by the rules of the game that everyone else is playing. A hard fork, on the other hand, requires a formal change in the protocol, in order to change the rules of the game: a new game is created. In that case everyone must agree on the new rules, not just the mining nodes. Opposing the concept of soft forking (I mean in general, not in particular to freeze The DAO's funds) is like saying ""mining nodes should not be allowed to freely decide what to approve and what to disapprove"". Opposing the concept of hard forking (and again I mean in general, not in particular to return The DAO's funds) is like saying ""the rules of the game should never change"". So, they are different beasts, conceptually.",t3_4oxo87,giact
"Yes indeed.  Those are the differences between the forks. I'm saying that if one is right, the other is also right.  Why did we soft fork?  Something went badly wrong.  Every miner who accepts the soft fork agrees. All I'm saying is that the moral principal for the soft fork is the same as the hard fork.  If we agree something has gone badly wrong we can also agree that we can at least spare the victims of the accident.",t3_4oxo87,TangoandETH
"Because written everywhere on the DAO page says the code is final, and it may have bugs that cause a loss for everyone. Because everywhere the developers of Ethereum said this contract system is immutable. And now you want to change the rules of the game because you took a risk and lost. If you had gained a lot of money it would be just as fair if everyone who didn't invest wanted to create a hard fork to take a portion of your profit.",t3_4oxo87,ohcomethefuckon121
"Because everywhere the developers of Ethereum said this contract system is immutable. Note: this cannot be technically correct. The current Ethereum protocol is designed with an expiration date that will  require  a hard fork (and thus a change in the rules). This was done to prevent miners from stalling forever when PoS will be ready, but this also means that Ethereum itself as a protocol does not promise eternal immutability of its own rules (in fact, in this case, it's explicitly designed to require a modification).",t3_4oxo87,giact
Your talking like hard forking is changing the universe.  It isn't.  We have 2 scheduled major hard forks and the rules will change.  That is also all over the place.  Ethereum is not out of Beta.  The solidity contract should not have performed that way. Some people argue that it should?  It's worth having this discussion. I don't want to encourage further hacks. I don't want people to think that this is all some untested casino game where you can lose for no reason at all.  I read all the warnings.  I knew the risk.  I also know we can rectify this.  I haven't yet heard a good reason why not.,t3_4oxo87,TangoandETH
"Not necessarily. I mean: you are basing your moral conclusion uniquely on your morality about the ""alleged theft"" (note: I do agree it's a theft, but some people disagree with that, hence why I say it's alleged). Many people, though, are factoring in their morality on whether it's right or wrong to ""censor contracts"" (soft forking) and/or ""change the rules"" (hard forking). Note: I mildly agree with the soft forking (let's say I am 60% pro and 40% con), and I very slightly agree with the hard forking (let's say, 51%/49%). So I am not saying this to disagree with your moral view, but to explain why different people hold different opinions on this issue.",t3_4oxo87,giact
If its not a theft?  Is it a joke?  LOL Don't think I'm not having fun here.  I wanted front row seats.  Doesn't mean that if the roof falls in its all my fault.  I don't even care about the roof.  Just get us out unhurt. There is still a lot to negotiate.  Like what if the refund is implemented in the Serenity update.  That's years away.  Its a suitable penalty.  Plus we could include other hacks we have yet to find.,t3_4oxo87,TangoandETH
"If its not a theft? Is it a joke? Wait... why are you asking me that? I am not the one holding that position. I am just telling you that people exist who do not consider it a technical theft because they think that ""code is law"", including buggy code. There is still a lot to negotiate. Like what if the refund is implemented in the Serenity update. That's years away. Its a suitable penalty. Plus we could include other hacks we have yet to find. I agree. The other side of the coin is that the stolen funds could simply be frozen and forgotten and be considered a loss. That's in line with the view that The DAO was a risky investment that people speculated on, and losing everything was part of the financial risk. Again: I'd prefer to eventually refund the stolen funds cause I personally consider the hack a proper (i.e. illegal) theft. But I'd also be ok with a different outcome, if that's what most users consider ""fair"".",t3_4oxo87,giact
"You're right of course.  If it falls to me to advocate for this fork then I will do my best.  That's my job (self appointed) now that the DAO is dead.  Call me the DAO's interlocutor. Help is appreciated though folks. :) People will ask what happened to the DAO. A1: ""Well that thing blew up.  Everyone lost.  Sucked."" A2: ""We fixed the ever living blockchain out that bug.  Everyone got their money back luckily and a few others too.  It took years.  We all knew the risks.  So to answer your earlier question, the community simply won't stand for destroying the earth.

"The involvement of the Ethereum foundation in the DAO has been and is a mistake. As I see it Ethereum is supposed to be the foundational infrastructure upon which a flurry of projects and experiments are supposed to blossom, and in order for them to blossom they need a foundation that is strong, and that has integrity in the face of challenges. The hard fork proposal is a compromise that ruins that integrity and signals that projects like the DAO can influence the underlying foundation to their own advantage. To me that is totally unacceptable and is a departure from the principles that drew me to Ethereum. The hard fork is a valid option, but should be kept for situations which require emergency modifications of the Ethereum protocol itself, and not for projects that run on it. The fact that the Ethereum foundation has been involved in and promoted the DAO project has been an error and it only usurps the trust that people have in Ethereum as a foundational infrastructure for other projects. I hope they will correct this error. Whatever the outcome, I hope that the Ethereum community continues to deal with this issue in a civilized and mature way and I wish all the best to the people that were affected by this incident.",t3_4oiqj7,nustiudinastea

And then eventually the pile-building phase of the contract ended and we were left with a whole lot of people breathing heavily in excitement looking at this gigantic pile of money and having no idea what they'd just done. IMO this was evidenced by the number of posts I saw afterward where people were asking really basic questions about how the DAO they'd dumped their money into was supposed to work. I'd like to think that maybe people have learned something from this. And maybe a few lessons have indeed sunk in. But it's a pattern that repeats over and over throughout human history, so who knows how long this moment of sobriety will last.

The miners actually intentionally colluded to execute a 51% attack and forked the code to fix this problem . Nobody is complaining about that now. Of course, this was a problem with the core code, in ethereum's case the code worked as intended, a contract contained a bug, so they are not perfect analogues. But at the same time, bitcoin does not have the capability to run contract code, so this is as close of an analogue as you can get. This incident is capable of destroying faith in ethereum, to the point that it could never recover fully. I don't like the idea that the foundation is capable of this, but so long as the capability is removed when we are in a more stable stage of development I think it is fine.

Looks like my worry was real  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3l5uuh/three_major_concern_about_ethereum/,t3_4oiqj7,[deleted]
Some discussion is also happening here.  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4ul121/the_dao_and_the_benefactors/  I would really like to see your opinion on that.,t3_4unpm3,daoholder
"As soon as The DAO attack happened, I've sold all my DAO tokens cheap. Why would you admit that with pride? Buy high, sell low. Smart guy. Why did I do it? Because all of us had an explicit agreement, stated many times: transactions are immutable and code is law. Yet things can still go wrong. Ideals and goals can get overtaken by reality. But normal people come down from their cloud and face reality. Yes it sucks, but no need to be religious about it. If you are in a safe place, and someone kicks you down. Will you stay down because it was supposed to be a safe place? Will you not defend yourself, because it is a safe place? Ideals are important, it is something to work towards. Even after a setback. But doing nothing when you can do the right thing......that's not morally superior at all. So it makes sense: if code is law, attacker will get as much money from the DAO as he wants, which renders DAO tokens worthless. Nope, still doesn't make sense to me. Zero-tolerance rules rarely make sense to me, maybe I'm weird like that. Some of you, who, for some reason, hesitated to sell at a discount, or had hope for some solution to revert the attack, have kept your DAO tokens, and subsequently sold Ether from The DAO at a much higher price, were motivated to support the hard fork. What about people who saw a community which was not stricken with debilitating perfectionism (like Bitcoin Core) and bought the DAO tokens you sold because they believed the community to be pragmatic. And who saw (and still see) that as something good? Crippling perfectionism and extremism are  not  virtues which deserve to be protected. You have no moral high ground to stand on, even though you think you do. have breached the agreement, supported the hard fork and managed to benefit from my losses. Sorry, hate to break it to you, but the DAO agreement covers THE DAO. Not Ethereum itself. Not the community. Not miners. Not ethereum holders. Not the people running nodes. They are all  NOT  bound to the agreement. Well, good for you - when money talks, you don't really care about your agreements, principles, or the fact that you’re taking advantage of a contract violation to serve yourselves. There is that high horse of yours again. Making stupid assumptions that this is all about money. But in reality you can't even see that this is about the health of the entire network. That sometimes pragmatism trumps perfectionism. That sometimes the exception does make the rule. Don't think for one second that we do not still believe in immutable code. Because we do. Stopped reading after that.",t3_4unpm3,seweso
Why would you admit that with pride? Where have you seen me being proud? Or you're just making things up to have something to agrue/troll about? Ideals and goals can get overtaken by reality. Don't think for one second that we do not still believe in immutable code. Because we do. Were you The DAO investor? Do you have balls to share the price you'll sell your believes next time on public or will keep to yourself?,t3_4unpm3,daoholder

Can someone ELI5 what an Uncle is and why it gets a reward of 3.125 ethics when mined?,t3_6mteq5,booyah2
"If I understand this correctly: Sometimes 2 different blocks are added to the blockchain at approximately the same time because 2 miners almost simultaneously find a solution to the mining problem. So part of the network sees block A as the last block on the chain, the other part sees block B as the last one. Next, both parts of the network start mining again. When someone who regards block B as the newest block finds a solution to the mining problem, then the new block will be added to block B. The chain with block B and the new block is the longest, so block A becomes obsolete and is called uncle. I think an uncle block gets a reward because at the moment the uncle and father block are created, things could go either way. I mean depending on the part of the network that creates the next block an uncle becomes an uncle and a father a father. This is not yet known at the moment an uncle or father is created. It is just fair to reward both the creators of the latest block.",t3_6mteq5,blueeconomy
That's what I thought. Because we have blocks being validated every 15 seconds there is a chance that 2 blocks can be broadcast to the network at the same time.,t3_6mteq5,booyah2

Imagine I put 10 ETH on it. Now if I want to send 1 ETH to someone else, I need to download the keystore file and put it into Mist, type my password and send the money. Because Mist needs internet access, nothing tells me that my password was not stolen by some keylogger and that my 9 remaining ETH could be stolen. What would be the recommended approach here?

I'd really recommend against building a rig if it's for making profit.,t3_6mteq5,kirarpit
"Hello, why would you recommend against building one?",t3_6mteq5,Subie117
"because the amount of money you would put to buy a rig would easily make you more money if you directly by ethers. example, $300 would buy you 1 ether at the moment but you'd never be able to mine 1 ether with $300 rig, given increase in difficulty over time and constant electricity cost. please do the math before you invest.",t3_6mteq5,kirarpit

You might not ever make profit given you have only limited amount of time till next December. After that it's most probably gonna switch to proof of stake. And even if you consider infinite time then also you might not make profit ever because of the increase in difficulty. It becomes a decreasing geometric progression with a finite sum. Which is smaller than your total investment. And yes I started a month back just for fun. But yeah I'll be willing to sold it off if i get a chance to.,t3_6mteq5,kirarpit

"Hi Ethereum community, I've been reading up on Ethereum now for a while and while I'm probably late to the party, I'm super excited about this technology.

It's a simple twitter clone that runs on the blockchain. What is causing me a bit of concern is the development of the cost involved to send a Tweet. In 2015 this used to be $0.003, in 2016 $0,02, in May this year we were approaching a 1 dollar cost per tweet. Is this blown up price and all speculation on ETH actually hurting dapps that have real usecases? Will the future PoS system tackle this issue? Am I misunderstanding something here? This makes it seem to me as if running programs on the blockchain would be limited to a very wealthy few individuals / companies.

The network hadn't synced yet so I was a bit nervous and the PC froze when the shapeshift transaction was in the way so I thought I might have lost it, but the online etherscan shows the crypto is in the wallet so I guess that's ok. I'm not sure if mist is trying to download the whole blockchain or what but it's not viable for me on my potato laptop so I guess I won't use it.

"You don't have to use an exchange or any third party to send ether to someone.

"The first thing you need to do is gain ownership of an ethereum address. If you have your ether on Coinbase or an exchange, then THEY own the address that your ether is stored at (which means they actually own your ether). To own an address means that you are the only person who knows the private key from which that address is derived. You can do this at myetherwallet.com (fast but less safe) or by downloading and running Mist or Parity (slower but more safe). Once you have your private key and keystore file and password saved and backed up, then send a small amount of ether to your new address from where ever you have your ether right now, then check your address at etherscan.io to see if the ether showed up. If it did, then, just to make sure you can send from your address, go to myetherwallet.com (or Mist/Parity) and send it back to your coinbase address or where ever it was. If that works too, then you know everything is working properly, and you can go ahead and send it all over to your new address in larger chunks, checking etherscan each time to make sure it goes through. Any transaction sent using MEW or the Ethereum clients (Mist, Parity, et. al) will cost you only the gas, as described in my previous post.",t3_6mteq5,teeyoovee
That's great! Thanks :) I have one more question (sorry ;_;). How would this work if I was using a hardware wallet?,t3_6mteq5,[deleted]
"I've never used a hardware wallet, but from what I understand, at the step where you're sending the transaction, the program you're using sends a message to your hardware wallet about the details of the txn, the transaction is created and signed in your hardware wallet, and then the hardware wallet sends back the signed transaction, which then gets sent to the ethereum network. So it's the same except your private key is inaccessible to any other device except your hardware wallet, whereas if you keep your private key on your computer while it's connected to the internet, then hackers could find it and send it to themselves.",t3_6mteq5,teeyoovee

If I understand, the price of gas is set per transaction, so suppose I want to look at a list of different vendors selling the same thing the way I can on amazon and ebay, would there be 2 prices per vender per unit of whatever they sell, one in ether and one in gas?

"A futuristic technology experiment appears to have fallen prey to a common technological risk, as operators of a new investment fund based on a digital currency said they had suffered a catastrophic hack. A diagram outlines the technology of the Ethereum platform. DAO, a fund built around the digital currency, said ether was spirited away from it to another account.. A diagram outlines the technology of the Ethereum platform. DAO, a fund built around the digital currency, said ether was spirited away from it to another account.. PHOTO: JENS KALAENE/DPA/ZUMA PRESS Founders of the fund, DAO, which was built around a digital currency called Ethereum and which raised more than $150 million this spring, said Friday morning they have been forced to shut down the fund and plan for its unwinding. The attack spirited away roughly 3.6 million Ethereum coins, valued at around $55 million, from DAO to another account. The Ethereum Foundation said on its website that the hacker’s account was identified and effectively frozen. The attacker appeared to have exploited a loophole that essentially allowed a DAO stakeholder to create an identical fund and move money into it. But the code also imposes a waiting period that means the new fund can’t move any money for 27 days. The DAO’s founders are planning to “fork” the code and effectively void the hacker’s transactions. “The DAO’s journey is over but all funds are safe,” said Stephan Tual, the founder of Slock.It, the group that created DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. “All stolen funds will be retrieved from the attacker.” The attack occurred in the early-morning hours on Friday and quickly sank the price of the Ethereum currency, which had been trading around $21 before it started. Within an hour, it had dropped 38% to $13. Late Friday, it was trading at $15.03. The value of the “tokens” that function like shares in the DAO fund fell as well. The hack didn’t target the Ethereum network. “DAO token holders and Ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm,” Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, wrote on the Ethereum Foundation’s blog. “Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading.” Still, it is a black eye for the industry. DAO was set up in May as an experiment in using digital currencies and self-operating digital contracts to create a venture-capital fund that could run itself. But it was criticized early on for being poorly constructed, and there were calls for it to halt operations while it worked out its bugs. Those criticisms now appear prescient. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015 last December. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015 last December. PHOTO: JOHN PHILLIPS//GETTY IMAGES Investors seemed less concerned with the hack than with DAO’s decision to erase the fraudulent transactions. The move would be welcomed by most ordinary investors. But in the anarchic world of digital currencies, that sort of top-down reordering of events—even fraudulent ones—violates the decentralized ethos investors thought that they were supporting. One investor in the DAO, Menno Pietersen, said he opposed the rescue and called the incident a “horrible mess.” The DAO’s creators “messed up” and didn’t take the time to build their product correctly, he said. He acknowledged that he himself didn’t vet the investment carefully enough, but said that as a backer of Ethereum, he was against any fix that would invalidate the goal of creating a decentralized platform. If trades can simply be erased, he asked, “what will they do next?” “It was a risky investment,” he said. “You shouldn’t complain if you got burned.” Another investor, Collin LaHay, called the idea of forking a “scary precedent.” DAO’s funds were slated to be spent on supporting Ethereum-based startups through a proposal-and-voting mechanism. Startups would request funding, DAO stakeholders would vote on it, and if the proposal was approved, funds would automatically be dispersed. The startup began a crowdfunding drive in May. Investors put in Ethereum and got tradable DAO tokens in return, which conferred voting rights. DAO raised more than $150 million of Ethereum through the month, far more than its creators expected. That made it the top crowdfunding effort on record and brought a high degree of attention in the cryptocurrency world and even from mainstream media. “It’s not a disaster,” Slock.It founder Mr. Tual said. “There will be more projects. These are still early days.” The identity of the attacker isn’t known, but Mr. Tual thinks the person or persons may eventually be identified. The universe of Ethereum developers is very small, he noted. “I probably know him.”",t3_4olk46,MakeTotalDestr0i

He stopped when plans for a soft and hard fork emerged. He probably thought he had more chance of securing his funds if the community was divided.

"Are you wondering why Ethereum is losing value? This is because mass conciousness learns slower than individual conciousness. What people are learning is the impact ASIC miners have on an already centralized coin. Didnt know this coin was already centralized? Did you know that Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum and the founders of ETC forked the blockchain to the new Ethereum and the majority of the community switched over? (It even kept the name) That's right. The founders of Ethereum can change the protocol of the blockchain at any given time, making this as centralized as other coins like NEO. The protocol of the blockchain is currently being changed by these founders to once again, benefit themselves. They are changing from PoW to PoS. What does this mean? This means they are changing to an even more centralized cryptocurrency that ONLY benefits people who have a shit ton of ethereum (like the founders). PoS is proof of stake and they are changing to it under the guise of becoming anti-asic which the founders said they didnt care about in early 2018. But now apparently they do, right around the time they are centralizing the coin by moving it to PoS. What does this mean to the average Joe? This means you cant mine ethereum anymore. You can only buy it. And if you buy enough (the figure is really high) then you generate new Eth. So the people who will be generating the new Ethereum will be the ones who are holding the most Ethereum (the founders) So since they possess the majority of existing ETH, then virtually ALL of the ethereum being generated in the future will be in their possession and they will sell it slowly to other people so they to can potentially have enough to generate new ETH. This is by far the worst model for a cryptocurrency. The founders do the PoS to get people to buy more Ethereum from them (which gives the Ethereum they have more value). the incentive being you will make ""free"" ethereum by just holding a shit ton of ethereum. It tricks people into buying the centralized shit coin with the hope that they will get free money by just holding the coin. Do you know what other crypto does this? NEO. Have you seen what has happened to the value of NEOs coin? $60 to $20 and now its stuck at $20... you notice what other coin is also have one of the worst declines? ETHEREUM.. because they are both centralized PoS coins with founders that are essentially the CEO of the coin. It completely defeats the purpose of crypto. Remember at the start I said it takes the masses longer to learn than an individual. That is what is happening right now. That is what you are experiencing, a shift as people realize just how awful Ethereum truly is. Monero will gain more attention in the close future. Why? they are anti-asic. If they ever change to PoS it will be a PoW/PoS hybrid. Also, the crypto is far more closer to anonymous than btc and ethereum. The cost is cheap to send monero and the speed is fast. This coin will start to gain more and more attention and value as people learn that the value of a coin lays within a blockchain, not in what the founders say they will or wont do in the future.",t3_9bwikc,AfricanMonkeyGod

"There are a few rebuttals to this, although my technical understanding is limited. Firstly, the interest rate for staking eth has not yet been firmly established, and what information we do have indicates that the higher the staking pool, the lower the interest paid in reward. This puts a firm brake on the centralizing of eth holdings (ie. whales getting fatter and fatter). Second, the vast majority of mining is noncompetitive unless you're in Iceland with cheap electricity, or you own a huge ASIC mine in china. This is clearly more centralised than anyone would like, and staking is available to anyone with a relatively small number of eth (currently floated at 32) and there will be staking pools for people who don't have enough but would still like to participate. Last but not least: one of the main criticisms of PoW is its enormous energy cost, with eth mining alone using the equivalent electricity of the entirety of New Zealand. It is this environmental concern, especially in today's climate (change) that is the greatest incentive to move towards PoS.",t3_9bwikc,callofthenorth
"Serenity will be scheduled for 2020 (the proof-of-stake and sharding fork) Is this your best guess or do you know something the devs aren't telling us?

Phase one is actually the data layer, so coming to consensus as to what data is in the shards. Phase two is all about the state, giving meaning to that data and the notion of transaction.” Drake believes sharding phases one and two will come in 2020 and 2021, respectively.",t3_9bwikc,thepipebomb

"The ""trolling attack"" is an interesting attack vector I wouldn't have immediately thought of. But it's also mitigated somewhat by the fact that if you were to attack the DAO in that way and force people to split, you as a remaining token holder would have less total funds available for any legitimate proposals that you actually support. That's not to say it can't or won't happen, but in the case that it did, everyone who is ""forced"" to split would be better off splitting anyway. If a malicious actor has enough control over the DAO to execute this attack, I really don't mind being forced to take my money and run. Your commentary about how splitting works is also interesting, and makes me think that perhaps instead of a binary yes or no vote, we should be able to vote ""yes, no or split"" on any proposal. If the proposal passes, everyone who voted to split could be moved to a new DAO when it is executed and before any funds are sent. But that raises the issue of how a curator would be assigned to the new DAO, unless it's created without a curator and its members have to vote one in.",t3_4hkgsz,stevenh512

By contrast, the ""bylaws"" of TheDAO is ""set in stone"", the contract code cannot be changed now that it has been released in the wild.  This is something completely new, we have no experiences to lean on - we can only hope that those very smart people discussing the rules and writing them up have thought of ... everything.

From here it can get ""picked up"" by a miner; miners compete to process a ""block"" of transactions along with the updated state of the blockchain that comes as a result of executing the transactions. They also have to provide cryptographic proof that their updated state is valid. When they have all this, they send it to a node, where it gets verified and passed on to all other available nodes.

I am not sure how that person/group is selected but if done through the same voting process as proposals then how do we know the vote is not rigged from the start? I don't really like the idea, to me this defeats the purpose of the DAO. i feel like there should be stronger safeguards in place that don't rely on human intervention.

"I am Ethereum holder, but allow me to present some counter-evidence so we can stay realistic and know what the problems are. Regarding the uptime. During the DAO exploit, substantial DDoS attack was performed, which caused clients to sync very slowly. I believe that essentially means that Ethereum was taken out of service for that period. That means the network is presently vulnerable to the threat of a DDoS attack and so the uptime can not be guaranteed. Regarding 12 years old kid example buying shares. I believe, to date, it is not possible. ""Shares"" in form of tokens like DAO and REP are not really shares neither legally nor logically. Shares is an ownership of the company, which gives you rights to attend shareholder meetings, and vote on important issues in the company if you are a large shareholder. Business managers also have fiduciary duty to act in the interests of the shareholder. Of course, fiduciary duty may exist even in the decentralized autonomous organizations but as there are no legal rulings so this is currently a gray area. Now, I am not saying that will never possible for the kid to buy shares on Ethereum. But that today it certainly isn't possible. I believe we should focus on what can be improved, what the actual problems are, and not trying to market unfinished product that majority of people use only for speculative purposes.

"Good points. During the DAO exploit, substantial DDoS attack was performed, which caused clients to sync very slowly. I believe that essentially means that Ethereum was taken out of service for that period. That means the network is presently vulnerable to the threat of a DDoS attack and so the uptime can not be guaranteed. Technically still online but difficult to access. This is different than the outages that some major exchanges have incurred (like what I linked to) and exchanges can also get DDoSed. Point taken though. If you require the legal infrastructure and ability to attend physical meetings in order to consider things proper shares, then yes, DAO tokens haven't been real shares so far. Obviously the legal infrastructure is important for the existence of companies and a functioning economy, but what is important in my opinion is replacing the technical, trust, and network infrastructure required for today's IPOs with Ethereum and dropping the cost of such things to almost nothing. Anyway my intent was to highlight that difference, not so much the 12 year old thing (see my edit to the post). Although I do know a 12 year old who had a small stake in TheDAO (which is why I chose that age rather than saying 'anyone'). I believe we should focus on what can be improved, what the actual problems are, and not trying to market unfinished product that majority of people use only for speculative purposes. Once important issues are resolved, and needed features are added, the adoption will come without us having to advertise it. Agree. My intention wasn't to hype, advertise, or market anything, which is why I posted in  /r/ethereum  rather than other places. I assumed everyone here was knowledgeable about blockchains and the financial system (which is why I led with ""nothing here will be new to anyone"").

"but on the supply side, how many people want to invest in the 12 year old?  what safeguards are there to the investors?",t3_4yhcae,bitchess0
"The safeguards are in the code. Oh, you mean like traditional safeguards on Wall St? They don't exist. Imaginary lines. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns By November 2006, the company had total capital of approximately $66.7 billion and total assets of $350.4 billion and according to the April 2005 issue of Institutional Investor magazine, Bear Stearns was the seventh-largest securities firm in terms of total capital. A year later Bear Stearns had notional contract amounts of approximately  $13.40 trillion  in derivative financial instruments, of which $1.85 trillion were listed futures and option contracts. In addition, Bear Stearns was carrying more than $28 billion in 'level 3' assets on its books at the end of fiscal 2007 versus a net equity position of only $11.1 billion. This $11.1 billion supported $395 billion in assets, which means a leverage ratio of 35.6 to 1. This highly leveraged balance sheet, consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets, led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence, which finally evaporated as Bear was forced to call the New York Federal Reserve to stave off the looming cascade of counterparty risk which would ensue from forced liquidation. Criminals. Don't  ever  forget who paid for those bailouts, either. You did. Give me the 12 year old kid with a smart contract that says 'either I sell 10 widgets, or you get your money back' thanks. On the supply side, faith has been lost in traditional 'safeguards'. There is no such thing. At least with a smart contract, for e.g, if a crowdfund does not reach a target, or whatever the 'binding contract' is, as laid out in the code, the funds are returned, or whatever, via...code. Code  is  the safeguard. Not some human that is driven by greed, or some quasi-government entity and so-forth. There is simply no room for corruption,  as long as the code is tight .

To the 18th decimal point, it would show every tx the 12 yr old kid makes, in, out etc. It is so much better than a traditional accounting format, it is ridiculous. Not only that, it is instant. No waiting until EOFY. I can see an  instant  'cash' position of the business, its incomings, its outgoings etc. The positives far outweigh the negs, as far as I can see. I can trust it, more than I can a notarized document from any accountant - ever. Business logic can be built right into code. No? That is how I see things anyway...happy to discuss... We could even use the DAO as a great example of these safeguards in action. If I dare...",t3_4yhcae,eth_throw
"are you saying that if a 12 year old raises funds on Ethereum, that means all their business transactions are bound to be on Ethereum so that there is complete transparency?  didn't think that Ethereum enforces that, and sounds quite limiting on their business--all customers must have an eth wallet, etc.",t3_4yhcae,bitchess0
"It is undoubtedly where we are heading, IMO, yes. Raiden, for example can handle 1m transactions  per second , more than VISA. Settled in less than 1 second. Can VISA do that? No. Not to mention IoT + Ethereum/Raiden - machine-to-machine micro-transactions are going to be in the quadzillions. Yes, I believe in the near future, cash will be a remnant, like Gold coins (who would have  ever  thought that 1000 years ago? No one. If a 12 a year old kid is pitching an Ethereum based business, I would assume most of his outgoings will be ETH>BTC in the meantime. That leaves a trail. He/she doesn't have to use his actual ETH wallet to pay for the final product using Ethereum, he can use a ETH debit card etc etc. The receiving person doesn't have to accept BTC or ETH, they can be paid bpay/$$ from the 12 yr old kids ETH via infrastructure already in place all over the world. I don't want to get too specific with use cases and predictions, but in general, yes, I believe this is where we are headed. Print is dead. VISA is dead. Cash is dead. Long live ETH (crypto). lol. p.s - not trying to argue with you for the sake of it, i do just truly believe in 500 years this is where we will be. Maybe < 100. Maybe < 50. I currently pay for all things with a BTC debit card -works like any normal debit card. I go from ETH>BTC>POS. Completely fluid, so the kid does not have to pay with ETH. Soon the BTC middle man will be gone, and in fact soon I will have my ETH debit card. I can paywave like any other person, straight from ETH :D http://blog.coinjar.com/2014/09/24/what-you-need-to-know-about-coinjar-swipe/ Its great and I love it! No banks! See ya banks (hate banks).

I also think multi billion dollar market caps begin to signify 'significant adoption'. Look how the world banks are frothing over crypto.

Even if the amount put into the DAO by a given Ethereum user was relatively small (14% average), the total sum of money in the DAO stolen was relatively huge overall.

While, it's been explained, the simple point is: You can replay any TX across the chains in ethereum; you do not need to have identical TXs before it, or the same number. I don't think you understand the issue. Every TX on either chain is equally valid on the other chain, simple as that. There is no state that needs to exist for the replay to be potential. it's also account by account, I'm not sure why you think the ""weight"" of the chain has anything to do with anything -- it doesn't.",t3_4tc9x0,x_ETHeREAL_x
"All true, except that you  do  need to have the same number of transactions to execute a replay attack: if there's a gap in the nonces, the network won't execute the transaction with the higher nonce.",t3_4tc9x0,nickjohnson
"That's not true - the attack can be setup without failure. The attack tx execution may be delayed in certain cases.  Gaps are actually common for many contracts (off hand the secret money hiding contracts hiding ether in deterministic future nonces for example), and higher nonce is perfectly valid. The nonce will only cause a failure if it's lower than a previously used nonce on the same chain on the same account. Nonce value also can be set arbitrarily, there's no sequential requirement, and it need not correlate to the number of prior tx at all. Equality is not a requirement. Thafs all part of what makes this issue exploitable. That's actually what leads to the risk of future replays. Vessenes had some examples of how to exploit that in the article I linked above, you should read. And keep in mind the replay can go either way, the chains are equally valid.",t3_4tc9x0,x_ETHeREAL_x
"No, nonces that aren't sequential with the most recent transaction will be queued, and not executed until the gap is filled. Otherwise, Morden transactions could be executed on mainnet. The article you link to even says as much: if a transaction is issued with a nonce that is too high -- e.g. we haven't seen some intermediate transactions yet, then it is held in the pool of transactions until it is in order.",t3_4tc9x0,nickjohnson
"That's true, it's queued, but it doesn't fail. That was my point with the reference to future replays. I don't think that makes what the guy above you is saying make any more sense though.... Am I missing something? The nonce issue has nothing to do with sloshing around the DAO (if anything it's a numerical constraint not a state or origin issue), and nonce is not relevant to the heavier chain issue...",t3_4tc9x0,x_ETHeREAL_x
"Right, but queueing is synonymous with never running if the hole doesn't get filled by a valid transaction. And yes, none of the rest makes sense; transaction replays involving the DAO will only fail if they would cause the account to become overdrawn, so while an unpredictable subset of transactions will fail, it's difficult to say what that proportion is, and it likely won't be 'infectious'.",t3_4tc9x0,nickjohnson
"Not gibberish - after refund, that money will slosh back and forth between accounts and contracts, essentially ""diffusing"" into the blockchain. None of those transactions will be inside the other fork (if it manages to survive at all). Ethereum doesn't reorganise the mainchain just because a competing fork is longer, it has to be ""heavier"". Each block carries a weight too. This disincentives miners creating blank/small blocks. Bitcoin essentially just gives each block a weighting of 1 and then trivially the  longest  chain has highest score (since you just sum 1 for each block). In Ethereum, since blocks weights are a function of their transaction content, it's not necessarily true that longest chain wins, but the  heaviest  (one with greatest weight). So as more and more replay transactions begin to fail on old branch, blocks on old branch will be lighter and lighter. Essentially, no hope for the old chain to ever reassert itself. But by all means, keep wasting your time and promoting FUD, it's entertaining.",t3_4tc9x0,HermanSchoenfeld
"Like the twilight zone. Just words put together with literally no relevance. That post could of have been made by a random buzzword generator I swear.  I have no idea what you think the replay issue is, although I'm sure it has nothing to do with any of that. I can't figure out why you think the DAO ""sloshing"" around is important or what the heavier chain has anything to do with it. You could withdraw from the DAO on the forked chain, and I could replay the very next tx out if the same account on the other chain if it had a commingled balance to cover it - nothing is immunized by what it's touched before. That's just not how ethereum accounts work. This is not a utxo it is just a balance in an sccount, how it got there or when is not relevant. Unlike utxo there is no relevance to the state history of the balance or its origin. It's also account by account, the chain weight has nothing to do with it. As I said, if you think I'm FUDing, I guess the security experts and EF devs are too. Note too their responses have nothing to do with anything like what you said.",t3_4tc9x0,x_ETHeREAL_x

"I see a lot of post here in support of ETH. But, why is ETC price and hash rate increasing and is 30% of ETH ? Is this a statement against hard-fork or just exchanges and miners making a short-term profit ? It's an attempted speculative attack to take the market cap and hash power from ETH and give it to ETC investors. It looked like it might succeed yesterday, until the Bitfinex hack took down a lot of the participants. It seems much less likely to succeed now. We are likely to see ETC price and hash power decline precipitously if/when it becomes clear that this speculative attack has failed.",t3_4vyv3d,huntingisland

"""Speculative attack"" has nothing to do with conspiracy theory. It's simply a group of individuals, all doing what is in their best interest, leading to a speculation and market position based on the thesis that ETC will replace ETH as the primary ledger for Ethereum. It is a self-reinforcing thesis with a positive feedback loop, and had the potential of swapping ETC and ETH market cap shares yesterday. My guess is that the Bitfinex hack which sent many ETC longs running for cover interrupted that process. Once the ""story"" of ""ETC is gonna win"" lost its credibility due to a huge ETC sell-off, and clear statements from the Foundation development team, the speculative attack lost its fangs. Now ETC will probably go down to 10% of ETH market cap or so over the next few weeks.",t3_4vyv3d,huntingisland

In ETH, the DAO theft was reversed by hard fork by the will of the majority. In ETC, the DAO theft has been rewarded by tens of millions of dollars. If the market somehow ""decided"" that the ETC ledger was ""better"" than the ETH ledger, and worth more, then the market cap of ETH would be ""transferred"" to ETC. That constitutes the speculative attack. The attack failed yesterday, and it is now quite unlikely that ETC will be able to convince the marketplace that its ledger is a better investment.",t3_4vyv3d,huntingisland

However, we don't always get what we want, and I was prepared to deal with the possibility of ETC winning out yesterday.

So I went long ETC at ~.23 ETC/ETH or so as the pump was just starting. Once the speculative attack collapsed at ~.50 ETC/ETH and sold lower, I sold 70% of my ETC position and went into ETH and cash.

"I sincerely hope that you cover the actual historical truth about the what happened with the DAO which has been wildly covered in the media. In a nutshell: The community suffered a great tragedy with the hack of the DAO.  At the time, the attacker was seen to have the ability to walk away with 15% of all outstanding ether.  This was seen as a potential existential threat as the attacker (who apparently hated Ethereum) could use the funds malevolently on the network for a great length of time, or even, it was thought, perhaps threaten the very proof-of-stake future of Ethereum.  It was actually no laughing matter, as some try to paint it now with revisionist history. The community struggled to find a way out, initially trying to simply freeze the DAO attacker's funds (with an actual fork that went through the network and then had to be reversed requiring the faithful synchronization and cooperation of the entire mining community who were in deep decentralized agreement) but it turned out to be technically not possible.  Many DAO investors were willing to lose their funds to save Ethereum.  Please see:  http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/07/05/eth-is-more-resilient-to-censorship/ The Ethereum Foundation and others polled the community in as many ways as they could to find out the sentiment.  The estimates are that 85-90% of the community was for reversing the attack as it was 1) perhaps unrepeatably-possible due to the DAO time freezing contracts and 2) it was very early in Ethereum's trailblazing history (far beyond the scope of anything that Bitcoin has ever, or even could possibly attempt). The community clearly voted to reverse the DAO hack. Please see Joseph Lubin's comments on this subject: https://medium.com/@jmlubin/i-am-really-confused-i-thought-the-fork-wasnt-because-of-a-bug-so-much-as-because-somebody-ac5d3b27bcc9#.kor6k1vx0 Please see Emin Gun Sirer's historical opinions as well (the following link and others): http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/17/thoughts-on-the-dao-hack/ The extremely well-meaning Ethereum community has been lambasted with incessant false accusations in an attempt to revise history: The Ethereum Foundation used force Ethereum is centralized Reversal of the DAO attack was a ""bailout"".  A bailout takes funds from one group and give those funds to another to prevent a financial failure.  The DAO fork was in no way a ""bailout"".  It was the return of stolen funds, plain and simple.  The term ""bailout"" is used as a defamatory term and is an untruthful characterization of what took place. Code is ""Law"".  Please note that Pamela Morgan showed that the DAO was basically a General Partnership, and just because there was a flaw in the code does not make the attack legal, moral, ethical, or otherwise.  This constant false diatribe from the ""Ethereum Classic"" side is equivalent to saying that your business partner who absconded with your company's funds, did so rightfully  simply because she had access to the funds .  This utterly fallacious logic would justify every theft that has ever occurred in all of history. Here is a fun comment from the past, ""Welcome to the real world mother fucker. Where the smart take from the stupid.""  See :  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4va83x/ethereum_classic_is_now_a_den_of_thieves_where_15/ Ethereum is now ""mutable"" whereas ""Ethereum Classic"" is ""immutable.  This is so false.  The truth speaks to the very limitations of blockchain technology itself:  all blockchains are technically immutable in extremis.  All blockchains are communities of humans.  If the distributed community, which comprise a ""blockchain"", can rally over something so significant as to effect the entire network then, of course, changes to a blockchain can occur.  THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY OF BLOCKCHAINS.  This has happened in Bitcoin and it can happen in every blockchain. See comments at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5023go/vitalik_and_i_did_a_podcast_with_cdixon_from_a16z/d70pc8y/ I've actually even received messages on reddit that I, specifically, should die for the choice that the Ethereum community made (to return stolen funds), showing the level of consciousness that emanates from the Ethereum Classic domain.

We could prevent theft if everyone was monitored 24/7 by the FBI, right? But surveillance states are also bad, and privacy is good. So a balance must be struck. In this case, ""theft bad!"" was in direct competition with ""mutability bad!"" Someone who supported the fork and someone who opposed the fork might well have believed that theft had  exactly the same  level of badness as each other - they could both deplore the theft. But for some people ""mutability bad!"" ranked even  worse . So sure, a theft was reversed. Good karma. But in the process the principles of Ethereum and the security of its blockchain were broken.  Bad  karma. The balance is not an objective measure, it's something each person decides upon for themselves.",t3_4uy02z,FaceDeer
"Yes, we always create karma and that is the law of nature that it has consequences. Supporting the quite clear case of theft and opposing the effort to stop it is a ""bad"" karma in regards to getting the bright acceptance. With ETC and its community, build on some principles which can't be accepted (or even understood) by the majority of the humans.. Well, it's actually pretty straitforward, that it (ETC) will never be used by the majority of the normal humans. This is what I meant with ""bad"" karma. ETC will never be the dominant chain.

If this is true, then I can't exactly call this a hack, but rather Yunbi's incompetence as a major exchange for not following ETH news at such a critical event. Why do I suspect this? Because two days after the fork, I withdrew 162 ETH from Gemini exchange, and still got 162 ETC because Gemini didn't split their wallet. I realized I could've easily deposited ETH to Gemini, then immediately withdrew them and gained ETC in the mirrored wallet address, but having some morals I didn't.

"Reposting from my comment on  r/theDAO : First, it takes 7 days to set up such an attack, which would put his first commit within 24h of the race to empty security advisory being published. I estimate about 100–200 people in the world have had the necessary exposure to Ethereum and enough mastery of Solidity to pull off such an attack in such a short time frame. Yeah, I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. For one thing, this isn't one attack, it's actually two; there's a double-spend coupled with the fallback function recursion.  The ""attacker"" was able to extract ETH to a child DAO without actually spending any DAO tokens. I was able to put together a proof-of-concept smart contract capable of repeating both exploits in a matter of hours... It's not hard (this is my introduction to Solidity, btw).  Solidity is simple, the rules of contracts are simple, and finding loopholes in the code is simple. For another, these fallback function execution bugs have been known about for far longer than the security advisory has been around.  The security advisory was just about a specific instance of recursion, but the general problem has been known for some time.

"I am pretty new to the Ethereum community but currently manage a small bitcoin farm/investment group and proposed to the others in my group that we bulk buy Ether the day before the attack...oops. Anyway, I have seen the debate in other threads about whether or not to fork and from the way you explained it, the hard fork would do nothing more than solve whatever issues the theft may have caused.

"I understand that there are purists but wouldn't the scale of this attack warrant such a move and overall be beneficial to Ethereum's future? This is essentially the balance of arguments. Some think that Ethereum (so far) has not needed any structural hardforks to correct the actions of smaller groups within the chain and would like to see that track record continued into the future (forever if possible), while others think this situation needs the change for the reasons you mentioned. I don't think the purists are ""wrong,"" there are just other arguments to consider in reaching a conclusion.",t3_4p0b4w,wejustfadeaway
"Thanks for the reply, it helped me see the other side of the argument a bit more. My question then is, if we are now aware of the problem in the code that allowed this to happen, and have the ability to return the stolen tokens to the right hands while also stopping the same kind of attack from occurring again, what potential negatives exist that could stem from the fork? Wouldn't the fork need to be implemented either way to avoid a similar attack in the future?",t3_4p0b4w,JDUBZ1006
"The DAO is dead, either way. No one is attempting to bring it back in it's current form. What will happen in the case of a hard fork is simply ensuring all ETH is returned to all the individuals, not that The DAO lives on. This is a 2 step process, the first of which is a hard fork, the second is an action taken by each user: Get the ETH into a contract that has one function: withdraw. Allow users to click ""withdraw"" and get their ETH, proportional to the amount of DAO tokens they hold. The soft fork proposal is to ""freeze"" everything in all DAOs (main DAO, child DAO, attack DAO) so that no ETH from these DAO's can ever reach the market. They will be trapped. That includes the stolen ETH and all ETH held by innocent parties, like the people who were in the process of splitting when this went down. In the case of a soft fork, nothing can be done so no one can exploit the bug further. In the case of a hard fork, the ETH would be in a new contract without any bugs (this contract will be dead simple and vetted by the the masters and researches, obviously). Now there is also the larger issue of: how do we prevent a similar thing from happening in the future? What can be learned? Vitalik  has recommended that: (1) be very careful about recursive call bugs, and listen to advice from the Ethereum contract programming community that will likely be forthcoming in the next week on mitigating such bugs (2) avoid creating contracts that contain more than ~$10m worth of value Developers, cryptographers and computer scientists should note that any high-level tools (including IDEs, formal verification, debuggers, symbolic execution) that make it easy to write safe smart contracts on Ethereum are prime candidates for DevGrants, Blockchain Labs grants and String’s autonomous finance grants. Many really, really, really smart people have analyzed the code and exploit to determine what happened, why it happened, and make code recommendations on how to not have it happen again. Most recently, that was Phil Daian  here : As a recommendation, do not call external contract code in your contract using Solidity’s call construct, ever if you can avoid it.  If you can’t, do it last and understand that you lose all guarantees as to the program flow of your contract at that point.",t3_4p0b4w,insomniasexx
"Everything insomniasexx said is true, so to tl;dr: the hardfork only stops the DAO by moving its (and any childDAOs') funds into a withdraw-only contract. It doesn't ""fix"" any inherent bugs in the DAO or in Ethereum generally, or ""stop"" the same type of attack from occurring again. Future smart contracts must learn from this on their own and not contain the same recursive call bug that the DAO had, and I doubt miners will reach consensus in HF-stopping any future contracts that make the same mistake after this. But no, the HF is not necessary to avoid this same bug so long as smart contract developers learn from this, it's really just whether the attacker is stopped and whether token-holders get refunded. As for potential downsides, I think they lie in how the system will respond to retrospective HF-solutions to other, future failed experiments. I guess each situation will dictate how consensus forms, but less optimism is the basis for purists' arguments. Personally, I hope it does its best to encourage risk-taking and innovation while discouraging negligence, but time will tell. I'm not aware of any technical risks of the HF so long as the ""savior DAO's"" code performs properly and does not clash with anything else (no specific examples come to mind, but these types of things usually happen unexpectedly).",t3_4p0b4w,wejustfadeaway
"wejustfadeaway is correct. The arguments I have seen is : the code is god, do not change the code, whatever happens happens, it's immutable, etc. The other is the typical slippery slope fallacy: ""if we do it for this, will we do it for that?"" which is a distraction and a fallacy and should be ignored as such. The other, which is my least favorite is, ""the people invested in the dao without doing due diligence and should lose everything as a lesson."" This is just a simplified overview of the arguments and I'm sure I'm not doing them justice. There are also a lot of holdover ideas about what a hardfork means for Bitcoin that do not necessarily apply here, since we can limit this to The DAO AND Ethereum has true balances rather than running on unspent transactions. This enables us to be very precise with what the hard fork will affect and the HF solution proposed by core members of Etheruem is very, very elegant, IMHO.",t3_4p0b4w,insomniasexx

"The proposed hard fork doesnt change any past transactions, it only replaces the the main DAO's byte code to a contract that only allows withdrawals. Nothing from the past blocks will be changed. I'm less familiar what the hard fork would do to the Dark DAO, probably something similar. edit - The Dark DAO's byte code wouldn't be changed probably, just the 3+ million eth would be transfered back to the main DAO. This is my understanding.",t3_4p0b4w,dao-er
"A hardfork could be as simple as changing a single line of code in the validation of a signature in a transaction that moves ether from all contracts with the codeHash of the DAO into a new  custom contract tx.hash == 'hash of hardfork tx' || tx.hasValidSignature() It wouldn't cancel nor rollback anything.

"It's definitely been thought of. The reality is, the fact that the attacker was first gives them the massive advantage of ensuring no one else is in his child dao. If someone were to pull this move, they would be trapped in a child dao with whatever amount of eth. This child dao is susceptible to the same attack as well and, because everyone knows this, anyone who voted yes on the proposal would be able to enter and thusly exploit again. Basically it would just be diversifying where the white hat and black hat attackers had eth that belongs in the dao account.

Even without a fork the attacker won't get anything. The white daos can be stalked by ad infinitum split attacks as mentioned by the other posters.

"I myself am learning Coq with an eye toward using it to write completely verified and proven smart contracts, thus limiting any errors that might occur to flaws in the design rather than in the implementation. I think this is the only valid approach, given the prospective permanence of smart contract code. We don't need a lot of code out there, so the methods don't need to be approachable at all. They  do  need to be rigorous. Solidity is nice in its own ""let's just start writing some code"" way, but that's really not what this space needs, IMO. If there's to be a language designed for ease of use, it should limit the user to the point where they can't do anything dangerous, even if it means preventing them from doing anything useful. I say this because we are apparently unwilling to allow ourselves to undergo the Darwinian winnowing process that having dangerous-yet-accessible tools necessitates. Having dangerous-yet-accessible tools implies a willingness to let the problem sort itself out by letting those unable to properly wield said tools destroy themselves by the same. The ""The DAO"" bailout demonstrates that we are not willing to let people destroy themselves. Thus if we are to proceed without further crises, we must hobble such people instead. This means proper tools that demand rigor for those who have the necessary ability, and nerfed tools for those who don't. (Some argue that this is why Bitcoin will succeed where Ethereum fails, but I am not quite convinced that the process of developing software needs to be  that  difficult in order to properly filter out participants.) Edit:  I suspect we'll end up moving in that direction anyway, though it'll be a somewhat painful process that might see Solidity blunted or binned. If we don't, we'd sure as hell better formalize a process around handling these sorts of crises, because we're going to see a lot more than we'd otherwise. Edit 2:  Also please note that I use the word ""ability,"" not ""talent.""

"I guess I was mostly thinking about what you said here: We can't keep forking ethereum every time a contract gets hacked. I think there will always be some risk of hack, like most programs. Are you sure no other Eth contract has ever been attacked successfully? I suspect they have, but it wasn't ""a lot of money"" so you never heard of it. So I was just approaching it from a global perspective, where contracts may always fail.  This will always be bad for the people who are using that contract, but it's better if the percentage involved isn't so large so as to threaten the entire network.  That way you can be assured they won't need to ""keep forking ethereum every time a contract gets hacked.""

Some would not think twice. The key is to allow a price signal to exist that reveals the probability of fraud.  There were experts who pointed out the DAO vulnerability before it was acted upon. Surely some people who took them seriously would have wanted to take a position on the insurance contracts! At bigger scale, it works better and better. Contracts will  never  be perfect, and as ETH grows, so will the cost of programming mistakes. Insurance lets people put their money where their mouth is about security and the intended/predicted behavior of contracts. Even mainstream savings accounts come with $100K of insurance, the premiums of which are paid for by taxpayers.  My point is that even very established, low risk systems benefit from some sort of insurance.",t3_4u7nyx,umami99

It should also be made clear that prior to the WhiteHat attack, no one knew whether an attacker had infiltrated their split. Remember that the WhiteHats only acted in response to an active threat at the time. Had no other attacks occurred (or had they occurred later), the WhiteHats might have had a split all to themselves with no risk of a Stalker attack. Alas, their hand was forced.

And that's if an attack is actively happening, and is happening slowly enough for good advice to make a difference.

When there are no attacks, and indeed no proposals at all, which seems likely to be a decent chunk of the time, what will they spend their time doing?

"you have to figure out how you're going to handle the old DAO tokens, either by issuing new tokens or by changing all calls in the new contract to reference tokens in the old contract Ah, that's quite a good point. Maybe that is where the complexity lies. In fact, neither seems to quite work: it's very non-trivial to import all the balances to the new contract, and if you do that, you change the address of the contract (which messes up exchanges, etc.). And you can't just reference the old contract, because the contract needs to be able to change balances (in the case of splits, for instance). If it does turn out that it will cost 10,000Eth worth of development work to figure out how to upgrade the contract, though, then that complexity is only there because Slock designed the upgrade path badly. There's no reason it should be difficult. This is actually one of my biggest concerns about this whole thing: it seems rather like rewarding Slock for the mistakes they made in designing the framework.",t3_4l2d7m,peterborah

Sometimes we blind ourselves to the reality of our creations, and try to secrete things away and protect them, when it's perfectly clear to anyone not attached that some of these projects should be put out to pasture. My point was to, without making a judgment, say how it is difficult to remain dispassionate and objective when charged with reviewing something one has had a hand in creating.

"Excellent article! In general, Emin's insightful writings have been one of the silver linings to the DAO saga. How likely is it that there are attacks against the token accounting mechanism in the main DAO? Not likely. I disagree with this. I think it's fairly likely that there are, since the attack surface of the DAO is quite large. It's not just the DAO code itself, it's also the entire Solidity compiler that could contain a crucial bug. Of course, it's a substantially smaller chance that any bug will be  found  soon enough to matter, but that's different from saying it doesn't exist.",t3_4to11x,peterborah

"Generally well balanced, but I was disappointed by the bit where he speculates on reasons why the minority chain might endure: However, there are a large number of people who see Ethereum as a threat to other cryptocurrencies (for entirely flawed reasons) and want it to fail. Further, some people specifically want Ethereum's hard fork to fail. These folks might well subsidize mining on the minority fork for some time. There's no consideration of people actually valuing the use of the original chain, the only motivation he suggests is malicious. That's likely not so, I expect there'll be a fair number of people who want to continue actually using the original chain.",t3_4to11x,FaceDeer

"The Ethereum ""brand"" has definitely weakened this year.  The longstanding criticisms that it is a Rube-Goldberg device with too many pieces-parts that could fail have been strengthened by the series of technical attacks, and the key developers' decision to build and support the DAO-related fork has provided a morality-based ""attack surface"".  Even more importantly though is that the DOS attacks and the un-mitigated replay attack vector have made the user experience less appetizing. My sense is that price weakness is almost entirely due to this brand weakness, because the use-value of ETH has yet to expand beyond speculation, and secondarily fuel for dApp research and experimentation.

Ethereum is providing new scenarios that are opening the conversation to crypto-economy core issues that weren't discussed before as much as now.

We even have a big size of the Bitcoin community considering a hard-fork to split themselves from BTC into a new blockchain, and a lot of people mention the ETC split as an inspiration in the sense that it has been demonstrated that you can hard-fork and survive (of course ETC could die any moment, but the fact that it showed that it can be done is a really important issue). The illusion of immutability also was broken by Ethereum, and demonstrated how crypto-economy is based not only in code, but also in community. There has also been a lot of discussion about the legal system, and a ton of researching about technical possibilities.

It's possible to attack the DAO in the same way and recover the 70% remaining. it's possible to attack the child DAO in the same way, and steal the funds back. Now, this even doesn't require a soft fork, though it would make stuff much easier. Also, I'm not sure how exactly easy is to pull off 2). I'm assuming we have someone in the Dark DAO who can pull it off (it wasn't the attacker's propsal), the Dark DAO has to wait a bit, and can then issue a proposal to pay the attacker. However, I believe someone can do a split before that, by the rules of The DAO. The attacker has two choices: ignore it (and probably loose all), join the split (and continue forever like this), or make his own split, try to drain the Dark DAO into Darker DAO. This will probably split the funds on each level and become pretty crazy, but i can see how the funds could be recovered. This is all WITHOUT SOFT OR HARD FORK.

"Well, it's still sort of a ""tax"" because if the DAO's Eth were to be burned instead of recovered the value of everyone else's Eth would go up. So ""restoring"" the supply would make their value go down again. Ethereum giveth, Ethereum taketh away. If anything, this ordeal has convinced me that the notion of creating tokens and using those as ""cash"" rather than Eth directly is actually not as silly as I'd long assumed. I'd always thought of it as a pointless extra layer - Eth is there, it's worth money, why not use it directly to transfer value in all manner of circumstances? But if there had been multiple different currency-tokens in play when all this TheDAO nonsense went down then the ones that weren't involved in this would have sailed through unaffected. So maybe focusing on Eth as just the ""fuel currency"" is a good idea after all - you can fiddle with its inflation and whatnot purely from the viewpoint of ""what makes Ethereum run more smoothly?"" Without having to worry about the other economic effects of messing with the parameters. I mean, there's still nothing wrong with using Eth for whatever it can be used for. It  is  cash, just like tokens would also be cash. If someone wants to sell me a grapple grommit in exchange for Eth I can pay for it in Eth. But if I'm writing an MMORPG or something I would definitely want to create a new token for use as its in-game currency to insulate myself from these extraneous economic forces.

"This issue became relevant because to achieve that goal using ethereum I need ethereum to work as advertised and not allow any protocol devs to be pressured into rewriting balances in high stakes situations. To work as advertised means that contracts are  tamper-proof  and execute exactly as users expect them to. Exploiting a bug at any layer of the stack (in the EVM/protocol, in contract code, in the solidity compiler, or anywhere in between) is  tampering  with correct execution (i.e. correct as  intended , not as  implemented ) of the contract. If it was a bug in protocol/EVM code, a fork-fix would've already been deployed. That the bug is in contract code does not change the fact that its a bug which needs to be fixed. If it takes a fork to fix a bug that the users (by majority vote) deem severe enough to be worth fixing, then we should fork. Opposing a fork on the principle that blockchain contracts are immutable is totally misguided. Contracts should be immutable in the sense that they should be tamper-proof! Before we decide to tell users, sorry, your account is eff'd and your funds are gone because there was a bug in the code and the developers, the community, and miners refuse to fix bugs in contracts after they've been deployed because the bugfixes are inelegant patches on top of otherwise neat protocol implementations (and one bugfix could lead to a slippery slope of future bugfixes),  consider the consequences :  “But, if this hack is not rolled back, the entire community will spend years talking about and defending this decision, to the detriment of Ethereum's societal value.”",t3_4op69x,cdetrio

When the attack resumes, if the target split proposal has been voted YES only by the attackers, the funds are lost like for the first attack. If somebody else voted yes, they can stalk the attacker by calling split(). Once somebody has stalked the attacker, there are two situations: 1/ The regular DTH has the majority and can make a proposal to get the funds out. Only problem is the attacker can split again and attack.  The DTH would need to follow again 2/ The attacker has majority and can make a proposal to get the ETH out, but then the regular DTH can split and possibly use the attack against the attacker.

They endangered the future of Ethereum and smart contracts that actually perform specific tasks by carelessly throwing money at something they didn't understand. Note that the amount invested is what causes talk of forks and issues with dominating POS. If The DAO had worked without any bugs, the token owners probably would have lost more than 30% on scams and failures. IMHO, a more reasonable division would be 20% for The DAO investors, 50% for a fund subsidizing Ethereum security research, and 30% for the attacker.

"Unfortunately I'm no longer sure minority splitting is a good idea. The reason is that while it does fix a majority robbing attack, it allows someone with a small share to simply convert their share into a proportional amount of funds; hence, holding portion k of a $x pool is equivalent to just holding $k * x; furthermore, because in the real world we don't often see people with funds putting those funds  into  a voting DAO, so they clearly see full control over a small pie as preferable to shares of a big pie, we can expect the majority of DAO shareholders to actually make the conversion of their voting tokens into ""full control of a small pie"" format, and we're back to just having a bunch of guys holding coins. EDIT: Had a long chat with Christoph about this; the conclusion is that yes it basically is possible for anyone to split the DAO and take their portion of the funds and revenues from devices that have already been activated - however, such an attack would be unprofitable and pointless, particularly because all of the social capital (including slock the company) would favor the ""legitimate"" fork.

You can get your money out again before any proposal gets executed, it doesn't matter how big that portion is, it's your ether after all. But when you participate in the vote, then your tokens are frozen (can't split). So in the case the majority voted for it, your portion of the funds will be moved and can't be retrieved. So you can't just move money in to vote, and then out again. Also, once you have used a split to get out, you can not re-buy your tokens, they are burned forever.

"I attempted to follow this conversation all the way down, and I think you still haven't figured out what textrapper is trying to say. His attack is as follows: Put 100% of your Ether into the crowdsale. If the market cap of the token ever goes above the value of the ether raised in the crowdsale, sell your tokens for a profit. Once the first vote is proposed, immediately split and recover all your Ether. This is rational for anyone to do, because there is zero downside risk (you get all your ether out at the end), and some potential for upside (if people want the token after the crowdsale). This isn't the worst attack ever, since no one's money is getting stolen, but it does mean that you can't trust the amount raised in the crowdsale to be an accurate reflection of how much money the DAO will be able to spend.",t3_4auw6z,Semiel
"Why should the price of the token be different to the price of ether before a proposal has been accepted? You ""only"" own a portion of a fund with ether.

"Our proposed solution is implemented by limiting each individual DAO to a single service provider. I don't think this works. The only benefit is that it will now take a majority attacker somewhat longer to complete their attack: they'll first vote to switch to themselves as service provider, and then vote to send all the money to themselves. Non-apathetic members can of course choose to create a split as soon as the switch occurs, but apathetic members will still lose their money. And since a non-apathetic member can always ""save"" their own money, the attacker can do this risk-free. If there's even one person who doesn't realize there's an attack ongoing, the attacker will make a profit. Even if they fail to get 51%, they can just immediately split with their minority stake, and not suffer a loss! The above is probably the realistic attack, but there's also a weird possibility where the attacker could ""follow"" anyone who tries to split. They would always vote yes on proposed service provider switches with a portion of their tokens that is slightly larger than the group that wants to leave, making them the majority in every splinter DAO as well. Then they would block any attempts to actually send the new provider any money, thereby locking everyone's money in place. They could keep doing this as long as they wanted, in hopes that people would get sick of playing the same game without any reward and become apathetic, allowing their money to be stolen. Finally, even if it worked, this seems disappointingly centralized. It seems like DAOs should have the ability to work with multiple service providers at the same time without having to get permission from Slock. EDIT: A few more less crucial comments. In order to prevent proposal spam, a minimal deposit is required to be paid when creating a proposal, which gets refunded if quorum is achieved This seems like a weird way to do it. Why is it quorum that determines the refund? This leads to a weird tactical voting scenario, where people shouldn't vote against proposals they dislike until they hit quorum. Which in turn leads to a potential attack: don't vote on a malicious proposal until the very end of the voting period, causing most people not to bother voting against it. Then vote at the last second with enough tokens to put it over quorum and win the vote. (It also means that someone who owns $MINQUORUM tokens can spam for free, although they probably wouldn't do that if they're such major stakeholders.) I'm also concerned about the quorum concept in general. 20% is rather a lot, and I think it's entirely plausible that interest will die down at some point, and it will become hard to reach quorum. The ""difficulty adjustment"" after a year helps, but a year is a long time. Can Slock GMB survive with a year of no funding? In order to avoid that possibility, all ether that is payed above the initial price of the token, will be sent to an extra account... This money can be sentback to the DAO through a proposal after the DAO has spent at least this amount of ether. This is insufficient. If someone splits immediately after the money is brought back, they'll get their initial investment back, and end up with ""free"" reward tokens. This is easily solved by changing ""at least this amount"" to ""at least three times this amount"", or some other multiple.",t3_4auw6z,Semiel
"No, the attack is not possible within this model. The DAO(s) can have as many service providers as they want. The attacker can only split into his own DAO with himself as service provider, and he only takes  his  money with him. So the attack doesn't take longer, it is simply not possible anymore. He can  only  take out his money. Although there is a default service provider, there is also a list of allowed addressed the DAO can spend money too. The service provider can add any address there so the DAO can make proposals to it. In the case the service provider refuses to add a legit address to this list, the DAO can split. but since the service provider wants to avoid that, he will most likely add this new address as long as it is not a scam. The reason for this ""only one service provider"" is exactly what you describe as ""apathetic member"". Because a 51% attacker can not make a proposal to send all the funds to him, which would spend the apathetic members money. He would need to split. But in a split  every  token holder would have to actively confirm that he wants to go with the new DAO. That protects the apathetic members. So in short, having a single service provider was neccessary to protect the apathetic member (unfortunately I assume there will be quite a lot of them),  but  i foresee a system of DAO's, each having there service provider funding and interacting as a group with there favorite project. But it could also be possible that all those new service providers are added to the white list to the original DAO as long as they are legit. The default service provider acts as a guardian, to check whether things are legit or not, to protect apathetic members. But in the case he misuses his power, everyone can go split into a new DAO. Regarding the quorum. Please note that additionally to the min quorum, it depends on the value being sent. So someone who own 20%, can spam the DAO with proposals which do not send any money. If the want to send all the DAO has received, they need 53%. In the GUI we will sort the proposals after the deposit (people can also pay more), this is the mechanism to sort the proposals after importance. I actually agree that the things that worries me most is that I don't know if at at least 20% will participate in the voting. I may reduce this number or the interval needed to half the quorum.",t3_4auw6z,CJentzsch
"But in a split every token holder would have to actively confirm that he wants to go with the new DAO. That protects the apathetic members. So what happens in the case of a ""legitimate"" change of service provider? Say for some reason the DAO is unhappy with the existing service provider, and an overwhelming majority chooses to switch to a different provider. What happens to the apathetic members who don't vote? They get left behind in the existing, now-defunct DAO?",t3_4auw6z,Semiel
Yes. Everyone needs to judge for themself. Because they should not automatically be moved to another DAO which they don't know and which could be a scam. So changing the DAO (=changing service provider) has to be an active process.,t3_4auw6z,CJentzsch
"I see. That does make my attack impossible. However, I think that has a lot of its own problems. For one, it's bad for apathetic members, because they might get left behind at any time. I imagine there's no way to join the new DAO later? If there's ever a change in service provider, you're going to have lots of people who come back after a few years and find that their tokens are now worthless, because they're stuck in an outdated DAO. It's also bad for the active members of the DAO, because it's a pretty strong incentive not to change service providers. If they keep the existing service provider, they have access to all the money in the DAO. If they switch, they only have access to the fraction controlled by active members of the DAO, who will be a small minority. In practice, it will be impossible to meaningfully switch service providers, because doing so will destroy the DAO. I think you've done a reasonably good job avoiding the 51% attack, but in doing so you've restricted the DAO to the point that it's not very useful. At this point, what's the advantage of having a single DAO with voting at all? Everyone essentially controls their own money all the time, so why is this different from people just owning their money the normal way? It seems like this is a very similar system, but with less complexity: Every $TIMEPERIOD, the Slock company asks the community for a given amount of money. Anyone who wants to can contribute to the pot, until it's full. People who contribute get reward tokens proportional to their contribution. A hook is provided so people who want to automatically contribute to every round can set up a contract to do so. The only real difference between that system and yours is that the total amount raised can go up over time, whereas the DAO has a maximum amount of funding.",t3_4auw6z,Semiel
"Apathetic members don't necessarily lose. Staying with the old DAO, means you still own that portion of that DAO, including the ether. So the minimal value of the DAO token, is always linked to the value of ether it still holds. When it has spend money on projects, the apathetic member still gets the rewards, as well as the splitted DAO. The only thing the apathetic member may miss out, are the spending opportunities of the new DAO, but that's it. Yes, everyone still controls there ether until the DAO did spend some. But a lot of small contributions make it possible to do meaningful larger spendings. So this decentralized managed organisation, is a very efficient way of bundling ether to put into single projects, without giving up control. Not more, not less.",t3_4auw6z,CJentzsch
"The only thing the apathetic member may miss out, are the investment opportunities of the new DAO, but that's it. This is the only reason someone would put money into the DAO: for the investment opportunities. With this system, going on vacation at the wrong time gets you kicked out of the DAO and makes your tokens worthless except for the cash you can withdraw.",t3_4auw6z,Semiel
"Essentially, the DAO will finance the Service Provider but then not have any rights to the IP that the DAO finances, if I understand correctly. The totality of the remuneration to the DAO will be ""part of the revenue"" generated by Slocks, without any consideration for sale of Ethereum Computers or other revenue streams? Yes, the DAO could 'theoretically' vote the Service Provider out. However, after the DAO has financed all of the development and has no recourse on the IP that it paid for, it seems unreasonable to expect that. This doesn't seem very fair for investors at all. Frankly, I don't see the reason for this 3 party system. Why not just have the Service Provider be wholly owned by the DAO (especially if the DAO is financing the Service Provider)? Can the founders demonstrate what percentage of development they will finance and what percentage the DAO will finance? How much has been spent to date? Regarding this topic generally, as investors in the Ethereum ecosystem, we should demand that DAO/crowdfund investors have the same or very similar rights that normal investors would in any other organisation. That includes certain rights with respect to IP. I hope that this strategy is reevaluated by Slock.it because in its current state it should lead towards lower interest in this crowdfund. I certainly will be pairing back my bet on Slock.it given the unclear path towards revenues and dividends with no apparent opportunities for other revenue streams. I expect some community norms and maybe even some Ehtereum Foundation guidelines to be developed over time to help govern crowdfunds and protect investors from unfair DAO structures.",t3_4auw6z,rzurrer
"Hi, In terms of who 'owns the IP', this depends entirely on the terms of the proposal from the Service Provider - and then it's up to the DAO to approve these terms or not.  Please see this message that explains a bit more how things are structured:  https://www.reddit.com/r/slockit/comments/4b510g/blockcharge_and_the_dao/d16yug0 In the context of the proposal Slock.it UG will make to the DAO with regards to the development of the Ethereum Computer, this will state that all the code and design that form the output of the work will be licensed as freely as possible, under the MIT license. Our opinion - which will be reflected in the proposal terms - is that it's in the DAOs financial advantage to see both the software and the hardware distributed as widely as possible, in order to benefit from the largest user base possible, as each subsequently deployed Ethereum Computer (build by Slock.it, or build by a third party) represents potential incremental revenue to the DAO.

"The fact remains that the DAO essentially finances Slock.it UG to develop the offering of products and services that Slock.it UG will eventually sell to other parties and the DAO wouldn’t have any rights to that cash flow. It should seem obvious that the DAO has rights to reasonable participation in any cash flows that the DAO’s investment finances. That should just be the basis of a fair and responsible relationship, as it would in any off-chain business. Further, It hasn’t be explained why it wouldn’t be more appropriate for Slock.it to be a single entity and the voting of the DAO pertain to the business operation of that single entity. It seems more simple and appropriate in this case where there will be a development pipeline that is financed directly by these funds. Do you not think that Slock.it will already be a very complex business to explain to potential clients? Why complicate it further with this capital structure? Obviously, the founders should have the right to a reasonable pre-mine of tokens, but the DAO should certainly be party to the totality of the free cash flows that this crowdfund finances and not just a single revenue stream of the many you intend to develop. I think we all really respect what your building here and everyone is very excited about Slock.it’s potential, but please give some serious introspective thought to the current structure. I hope a wise decision prevails. Especially given the commotion that you’ve raised in the past in the name of integrity, I was (am still) sincerely hoping that Slock.it designs a high-integrity business model that is reasonable for investors (many of whom will be under-informed on these issues at the time of the crowdsale). Also, it would be reasonable to make available more details about the revenue model, what has been invested to date and a product road-map with an accompanying budget.

Strong leadership? He barely said a word in days,t3_4qewct,bahatassafus
"Silence can be strength. My take on that is that Vitalik is letting other people develop stronger leadership roles in the community, rather than dictating his views as law. People would go along with whatever Vitalik said, but he wants Ethereum to have other strong voices besides just his own. And perhaps he's not 100% decided himself on whether to hard fork yet and his exercising caution by not speaking too early (his blog post which stated he was for a hard fork initially had that sentence removed).",t3_4qewct,shouldbdan
"Yeah, better to wait a bit and be confident in the choice one's proposing than to go off half-cocked. Back when the DAO hack first broke Vitalik announced the ""soft fork, then hard fork"" plan right away and there was a lot of consternation. I think it's good that he hasn't been looming over the debate since then, allowing it to shake out a bit on its own.

There have already been clear comments from a few Core Devs that ETC is not Ethereum. It's now the home of many Bitcoiners trying to make some sort of point but all they're doing is passing wealth on to pre-fork ETH holders who now have more ETH.,t3_4uo0mi,NewToETH
They just paid $250k for their corrupted partner to produce  toilet paper to make things look good... They all are involved in this huge scam.,t3_4qewct,[deleted]
I'm not sure so looking to hear from someone who hopefully says the $250K is incorrect. If not then from an outsider point of view it sure looks like the people who picked the security company and approved the payout were involved in a big payoff.  What I am surprised about is that nobody here even talks about that. To me the whole Ether DAO thing is one big scam being orchestrated by some of the developers with huge financial interests.,t3_4qewct,BillyHodson
"As somebody that has worked in the security consulting world for the past decade, it's more about how specialized the skill would be to actually audit the code. In this case it would be very very specialized.  Having said that, 250k is high for 2 weeks even with how specialized it is. The highest I've seen in the consulting world is about 15k a week. Even that's rare. So even if you had to have a ether code expert, which very few actually exist, the most I can reasonable see is 20-30k a week. Also for something that is so complex, to assume a auditor can go through all the potential threats in 2 weeks time is laughable. This should of been more like 2 - 3 months minimum.",t3_4qewct,nihilnonce
"Deja Vu said they obtained permission from Slock to make a statement, but haven't done so yet. We'll see what they say. I find it hard to believe the audit was comprehensive. Compare to their audit of Ethereum, for example. Something stinks here.",t3_4qewct,i3nikolai
"I can only find where Deja Vu said they  do not discuss ... without written consent . According to Ursium, Slock.it  gave permission . The number reported on Slock.it's blog is  ""five figures"" . There was also a copy/paste to the forum of a statement Tual made in the slack, which  implied a cost of $250k : The audit costs: 100% goes to the auditors. Who are, incidentally, not criticized for charging 250k+ to audit 1,000 lines of code. And why would they be? It's the price that they can afford to charge. You'd be surprised at the amount of 0s on the bill that Deja Vu sent to Ethereum when they ran their audit (very professionally I must say, and the quality was top notch... well worth the 0s). The DAO code is  941 lines . But perhaps the discrepancy can be explained by the  rumor  that Slock.it paid for the cheapest audit (five figures), rather than the most comprehensive audit ($250k+).",t3_4qewct,cdetrio
"They spent $250,000 for a 3 page report and a 2 week audit with their own money?  That does not really seem likely.  Nasa might spend $1000 for some toilet paper but when it comes to people's own money they usually shop around and demand good value.",t3_4qewct,BillyHodson

The ETC market is right now irrational. A recipe for disaster for buyers. Probably driven by ideology. The biggest enemy of good trading is dogmatic ideology. Good luck to them!,t3_4uo0mi,aribolab
"ETC has value because people want to: show support for immutability (whatever that may mean in practice :X) see ETC survive or even take over from ETH be able to replay ETC and also get ETH proof that a HF is dangerous destroy Ethereum entirely support the DAO attacker (financially) profit from ETC pumping/dumping So not all irrational... But long term viability is almost zero. It will probably settle at 1% or 2% of the value of Ethereum. My advice is still: Sell ETC and buy ETH (but only if you understand the danger of replays). Also, this can take a while, because exchanges might start offering trades between ETH/ETC giving it more legitimacy temporarily. So ETC will probably go up/down a few times. Maybe the Ethereum Foundation has to step in and at least make transactions incompatible between chains. That would increase security for everyone at least.",t3_4uo0mi,seweso
"At these prices you can add 16% to your ETH hodlings from converting etc to ETH, I only added 7% two days ago. People should be selling etc like hell today",t3_4uo0mi,Wegie
"Valid points, thanks. Could explain how they can benefit from being able to replay to get ETH? As I understand for replay the pre-fork account needs to have credit on ETH and you need access to that account in any either ETH or ETC. They only thing buyers could replay is coins they already have. Or am I missing sth here?",t3_4uo0mi,aribolab
"If you send ETC, the transaction will be replayed and the corresponding ETH balance will also be send along with it. If you are not careful and explicitly split your ETH & ETC.",t3_4uo0mi,seweso
"Yes, I understand that. Like I said, the replayed ETH will be sent from and received to addresses corresponding to the ETC addresses you sent from and received to. So you need to have access to the ETC sending address and thus you would also have access to the pre-existing ETH address, for it is the same. And that address need to have positive balance in ETH chain for the replay. It is thus your coins you are replaying, or at least coins you already have access to. How do you benefit from it? The replay only happens when the ETC recipient account existed before the fork, and you only can lose money in the ETH chain if you don't have any access (direct or indirect by knowing the recipient) to the account the replayed coins are sent to. As I see it, loses can actually only come in the ETC chain. It happened to me: an operation I did in the ETH chain to Kraken got replayed in ETC and now I have ETC blocked in an inaccessible account. Intentional benefits from replay in any of the two chains, I don't see how.",t3_4uo0mi,aribolab

"Of course there is an ideological base in ETH, as there is in anything the human being does! But the dump of ETC by many ETH holders and the speculation on ETH is not based mainly on ideology, and clearly not on 'dogmatism', which was my point. It's based on speculation on the development of the technology, thus trust on the system and the development of it by the foundation and the community. Part of the trust in the system is based on the stability and coherence of the chain. Most of those who hold onto ETH do it for the following reasons: The ETH would eventually be use for development of dapps which will make ether very valuable: The community of developers is healthy, growing and with expectations to develop good dapps; The Ethereum Foundation, and especially Vitalik, can be trusted and are very capable people who so far have delivered and will continue to deliver; The development of the technology towards Casper is guaranteed; The fork restored stability and security of the system, and kept the coherence by avoiding a rogue actor holding 12% of the ether, with the possibilities of disruption this could create; The community has learned key lessons to avoid similar situations. I don't think any of these are dogmatic points based on immutable beliefs, which could be considered 'dogmatic ideology'.",t3_4uo0mi,aribolab
The best thing to do right now is to separate your ETH and ETC using a fork contract (if you held ETH prior to fork then you now have both) and let things play out for awhile. Having the two chains may in fact help Ethereum ecosystem to grow and it attracting bitcoiners and siphoning funds from the Bitcoin clones of Ethereum such as counterparty and rootstock.,t3_4uo0mi,latetot

"I guess a lot of ETC holders would sell them, but it is a) too complicated to deposit  or /and b) too risky (replay attack vector). Pretty shady move from Poloniex though to add a trading pair with one asset for most user impossible to deposit despsite their auto credit. On top of that doing so without previous announcement. Pretty hard market manipulation there.",t3_4uo0mi,PhiStr90
"I don't think it's really as hard as people are making it out to be. When you send an ETH transaction to poloniex to fund your account, if it's valid on the ETC chain as well, you get credit for both currencies. When you withdraw ETH or ETC from poloniex, obviously they'll do it in a way so that it cannot be replayed on the other chain. So poloniex is actually a very good way to split your coins and protect yourself from replay attacks, as long as you withdrawal limits are high enough to handle your desired volume.",t3_4uo0mi,sfultong
The problem is that the replaying is not reliable. It is not done by Poloniex. Normally that wouldnt be a big problem. One would just try again. But for people having more than the daily withdraw limit that can suck. Imagine depositing 100k ETH but the tx doesnt get replayed. You cant withdraw and do it again as it takes several days to withdraw...,t3_4uo0mi,PhiStr90
"Oh? For some reason I thought they were replaying all transactions sent to their addresses. That's the rumor I've been seeing online. I can't find an official confirmation, though.",t3_4uo0mi,sfultong
no they are not. the replaying is most likely due to older clients cross talking with the new clients versions of each chain.,t3_4uo0mi,PhiStr90
"Hmm. Well, they should take it upon themselves to make sure that transactions to them are replayed. It would dispel a lot of worry.",t3_4uo0mi,sfultong

"The DAO attacker may never be able to dump his ETC if someone decides to stalk his new DarkerDAO, DarkerDarkerDAO etc.",t3_4uo0mi,RandomRealityChick
"It's too late for that. Those who could, stopped caring as soon as the fork passed. Now the ETC is in a grandchild DAO with no way for the ""white-hats"" to attack it.",t3_4uo0mi,DeviateFish_
"Nope the DAO in ETC has all the same quirks as when it was ETH. If anyone cares too, they can replicate the WhiteHat techniques that were used previously.",t3_4uo0mi,RandomRealityChick
"I'm well aware of that. The problem is that it requires tokens in the appropriate DAOs to attack them.  The complication there is that  only the parent DAO  can create tokens in child DAOs.  This leaves two ways of obtaining child DAO tokens: executing  splitDAO  (which requires you have voted yes on the split proposal before the voting period ended), or through a proposal to send DAO from the parent DAO to the child DAO (before its creation period ends). The former is impossible if the attacker has already split his DAO from the ""dark DAO"", because that implies the voting period for his split proposals has already ended (he's immune to stalking).  The latter is impossible for a couple reasons:  1) it requires approval from the curator of the ""dark DAO"" (unknown if they're cooperative), as well as a quorum of yes votes.  The white-hats don't have 20% of the tokens in the ""dark DAO"", so that's impossible--without the attacker even having to vote no. So in other words, the only way to attack him in the ""dark DAO"" was if they a) stalked his split proposals (they didn't), and b) drained the DAO before he could (they didn't). TL;DR: Only the curator multisig (the recipient of the tokens obtained from the ""dark DAO"") had the capability to attack the ""dark DAO"" at all, and they didn't.",t3_4uo0mi,DeviateFish_
How do you know the attacker's new split proposal wasn't stalked?,t3_4uo0mi,RandomRealityChick
"I can't verify until a bit later (i.e. when I have access to a node), but I have pretty high confidence it wasn't... Because doing anything to help the ETC chain isn't in the curators' best interests to do. If you have access to an ETC node, you can probably just enumerate the  Transfer  events to get a pretty clear picture, with something along the lines of: var darkDAO = web3.eth.contract(daoABI).at(darkDaoAddress);
darkDAO.Transfer({}, { fromBlock: 1718497 }).get(function(error, events) {
  events.forEach(function(event) {
    console.log('Transfer from ' + event.args._from + ' to ' + event.args._to + ' of amount ' + event.args._amount);
  });
});
 If there are only transfers from the attacker's two addresses (I don't have them on hand), it means the RHG didn't do anything. You can also do something like: var darkDAO = web3.eth.contract(daoABI).at(darkDaoAddress);
darkDAO.Voted({}, { fromBlock: 1718497 }).get(function(error, events) {
  events.forEach(function(event) {

(i.e. hacker dumping coins or some ETH whales dumping coins if they haven't already which would crash the market). or put another way, I believe there's a greater chance ETH will go to $100 than ETC will go to $10...",t3_4uo0mi,jesusthatsgreat

"Man you guys just aren't considering other perspectives! The hacker is the smartest ethereum programmer, doesn't answer to anyone, and is stuck on the classic chain. He doesn't even need a crowdsale to steer the development of ethereum because he's already funded! He can dump if he wants but the smarter thing to do would be to make it more valuable And getting out isn't even hard, barry silbert is doing block trades as is for high net worth people. With this explosive volume the hacker can get out without even touching the exchanges. All improvements to the ethereum project can be applied to both chains Yet the disagreeable parts from the ethereum foundation no longer exist on the classic chain but the world computer part still exists People like that",t3_4uo0mi,cqm
"The founder and founding team of any project / business (never mind one still in alpha mode) is critical to its future development... Without them we wouldn't have Ethereum... we wouldn't have ETC.. they've helped make a lot of people very wealthy (on paper at least) and they've shown much greater leadership than the Bitcoin foundation... Not accepting the direction they're moving in (which wasn't taken solely by them, it was reached by consensus), doesn't make sense to me, even if you had reservations about the hard fork. Hypothetically if Satoshi came along to the Bitcoin world again and put forward a case for a hard fork, it was approved and achieved consensus, would you reject that too? at what stage (if any) do you accept consensus as 'valid'?",t3_4uo0mi,jesusthatsgreat
"It didn't reach consensus, 8% of ethereum voted in the non binding referendums, and 8 mining pools simply installed the latest client. This was a rush job because the dao hacker would be able to move coins soon. See the thing is, in Ethereum Classic people are over the debate. Nobody cares about that anymore and has moved past it. The founding team made the world computer and it functions. The Ethereum Foundations own developers don't even have consensus on what to do with this outcome and some have stated they would support both chains. I don't think the founding team is any longer necessary.",t3_4uo0mi,cqm
"Consensus is when the majority of the population agrees on an outcome, not when the majority of the voting population agrees. The only consensus reached during the hard-fork was among pool operators and among the developers. The community was, and still is, split.",t3_4uo0mi,DeviateFish_
"Dude, consensus (in the cryptocurrency sense of the word, which is what we're talking about) is when 51% or greater of miners vote with their CPU power to mine blocks. As things stand, 85%+ of ethereum miners are mining ETH. There is no disputing that consensus wasn't / hasn't been achieved no matter what way you look at it... The only way consensus hasn't been achieved is if you want to redefine the term. Can consensus be reversed? Absolutely... people are entitled to change their minds... but it's probably unlikely as once difficulty increases and ETC becomes less profitable to mine or it's value drops (due to people trying to cash out and FOMO eases), there's then less incentive to mine it or stick with it...",t3_4uo0mi,jesusthatsgreat

Nobody is going to care if there was a hard fork in 6 months, bitcoin had multiple and it's part of the growing pains.

The DAO has received a huge amount of mainstream attention, the way in which we handle this serious crime currently in progress will determine how the project is regarded going forwards. Do we want the narrative to be that we stood idly by and let it happen? Do we want it to be that we tore each other apart in an ideological war just like the Bitcoin community we roll eyes at for doing? Or do we want it to be that we stood shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with those who were victims of the crime, and those who tried to build an innovation (however flawed), which would push the ecosystem as a whole forward?

"Everyone's talking about losing their trust in the system, when all we'd be doing with the fork is recover stolen funds. The only loser would be the 'thief'. How this makes anyone lose trust is beyond me, it should do the opposite (unless of course you're worried about the safety of ethers you've stolen from someone but I imagine this is rarely the case). Forking would not only recover the funds but also discourage any potential hackers in the future. What's more, it also would prevent Ethereum from crashing in 27 days when the stolen money would be unloaded onto the market. To me this is a no-brainer.",t3_4ojsjm,weissmanfred
"Right, but enforcing a hard fork without careful consideration may set a precedent for the future - that the Foundation or any other party with considerable sway over the network may at any arbitrary moment do this again in order to achieve some particular goal, however beneficial a goal they may see it as. This goes against the core principle of decentralised, community control. This ""optional"" approach suggested above is more measured and is effectively a way to get more community buy-in before making any such move.",t3_4ojsjm,hiddentao
"the core principle of decentralised, community control. By that principle, the community can and should coordinate a fork if they so desire. A vocal minority should not be able to block a fork on the basis of a short-sighted principle or subjective philosophy that its okay to fork to fix bugs in the protocol, but not bugs in contracts.",t3_4ojsjm,cdetrio
I disagree. The ethereum protocol (EVM + consensus mechanism) shouldn't make specail exceptions in the protocol about internal contracts because its not the protocols responsibility to protect contract programmers from mistakes. Its the contract's programmers and code reviews responsibility.,t3_4ojsjm,null_radix
"In general yes of course. In the real world, this got so big that the wider impact has to be considered. It's also so early for contract devs that it's hard to write safe contracts. MakerDAO also had to attack themselves and they've been at this a lot longer than the slock dao. This is more of a community lead approach than a hard fork.",t3_4ojsjm,newretro
"Should we put a rule into ethereum specification stating that every error in contract resulting in a loss of few hundred $ mil will be fixed by fork? Because, you know, these kind of errors WILL happen in the future. I propose another solution -> pay the hacker to return stolen ethers.",t3_4ojsjm,HandcuffsOnYourMind
"These errors are not inevitable, just look at traditional, 'outside-world' applications, you barely hear of hundred-million dollar loopholes in the news anymore. That is because there are clear security standards laid down. Smart contracts are still very new and in this beginning phase there will of course be errors in the system, and hopefully we can learn from what we saw today. But still, when Ethereum's market cap is just around 1.5 billion a loss of this magnitude has to be accounted for and since we now have the opportunity to nullify it I strongly think we should do that.",t3_4ojsjm,weissmanfred

"I don't know much about Stephan Tual. I -thought- the way people were angry with him that there was a conflict of interest and that he was one of the curators, which concerned me and made me worry about theDao and whether he would use his position as curator to push it through, due to his very human and emotional reaction. I believe firmly that no founder should also lead a company and mistook what he wrote about going through with posting updates on his project as a leader ignoring the needs of theDao. I still do not know at present if I am right or wrong or what that means. In which case I never personally had any hard feelings, and I think a lot of people understand he is human. This took us ALL by surprise. I myself found out about theDao on the very last day it was selling. I read everything I could and found one review on it from steem that made me reconsider. But I truly believed that the momentum would go up anyway. No one, no one ever expected a bad news report to be released. I can say that this news report is really a great way to test theDao. To weed out people not in it for theDao's best interest and only their own, and because 12mill is on the line it also means that it is in our best interest to really make sure this works. All eyes are on us and we really have to pull together to make it work. Stephen is understandably surprised and disappointed, we were all shocked and caught off guard, but none of us have to worry because I truly believe this is where we can come together as a community and really shine. Let's show them what we can do.  https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4lh1w9/dao_20_and_government_20_proposal/ We can  learn from the mistakes of bitshares and those who came before us, we can pull together, and we can make this work.

"Im not sure what you mean exactly. if you once and for all, and for all time, decide you do not care at all what happens on the other chain, then yes, you can simply ignore it. The problem is that no one can guarantee we won't need the other chain and that the hard fork will work perfectly. You may thing the chance is low, but how high was the chance the DAO would fail, or the SF would fail at similar points in time? This software is very rushed and it's not wise to just 100% assume it work perfectly the first time, and simply be ready to pack up and give up everything if not. More concerning, is that we can't guarantee that the second chain won't continue (given people seem to want to stay on it, and so it'll have some value and high mining rewards). So you may decide you change your mind about forever not caring about it, and end up robbed if you want/need to use it.",t3_4t2jfq,x_ETHeREAL_x

There could also be myriad game theoretical attacks possible, like we saw in the DAO -- this is a protocol level change and not just a single contract, it's very much more complex.

"You certainly can separate the money, even if someone were replaying transactions immediately: you just need to make a transaction that has a different outcome on each fork. A trivial example of this would be to use a ""fork oracle""; you deposit your funds into a contract, and the contract only lets you withdraw if you specify the correct value for the fork you're on.

"Wow. Great thread. I learned a lot from all the comments and replies. Regardless of what anyone thinks is likely or not, this is a great thought experiment, which we certainly need, so I don't think this is FUD at all. This kind of very detailed 'FUD' might have prevented the original problem. Having said that, as a simple user, let me ask: Do we know that the exchanges plan to follow a strategy that defeats this potential replay attack vector as outlined here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4t30ew/poloniex_announces_their_plans_regarding_upcoming/d5edz7r 2. What is the smartest course of action in the immediate aftermath of the HF for a user holding ETH in cold storage or Mist? Do nothing for some time? Immediately transfer ETH to a different address following something like the exchange strategy outlined above? 3. How can a replay attacker ever benefit from this attack, or is this just more something he would do to be a destroyer? It seems to me that capturing a transaction body would only permit funds transfer from and to the specified addresses, which he would not control on either chain anyway. I don't see his gain from this, unless it's just about damage. Very helpful discussion. I hope we promote  more, not less , of this sort of thinking and debate (detailing what-ifs for full examination).

"Whilst I've heard of replay attacks I decided to do a little more digging and came up with this results specifically relating to Ethereum. https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/26/what-is-a-replay-attack Replay attacks are eliminated by using different addresses/keys between the frontier network, and all other Ethereum chains.

"Not sure why this is being downvoted. Anyone can can track both chains by sending their eth to unique addresses on each. Yes, the process of doing this could be slowed down by replay attacks to one of your two addresses (which you own), but you would be in complete control of your holdings through the entire process. Put differently, the replay attack is only an inconvenience that makes it take n transfer iterations instead of 1, that's all--as long as you're only sending to addresses that you and only you control.

"Edit: the ""FUD"" was probably unneeded though. This situation is unprecedented so it takes time to think through it deeply.

He even claims that  such split is never possible , which is outright ridiculous, and after being pointed to this mistake, he twists logic and the words of the other person and accuses the other person of doing the exact mistakes that he is just doing himself.

"One interesting implication here is that the whole ""exchanges preventing withdraw on classic chain"" can be easily subverted. You just replay the forked-chain withdraw on the classic-chain and bob's your uncle. ...And thus there's a massive incentive for using this attack to continue adding value to the classic-chain by replaying every withdraw on behalf of everyone. But at some point the exchange's wallet will run out because of DAO token ETH being restored on the main chain...

Most of them will be to contracts and addresses that they themselves control, or to a second party that is intended to receive this ether.

"As I said above, if you can for all time with no exception guarantee you will never care what happens on the other chain, you need not worry. The problem is that no one can guarantee that can happen. First, as shown by the DAO hack itself, and the soft fork cancellation, we know that software doesn't always work as expected when we first conceive of it. This fork is pretty rushed, and I'm worried all the contingencies of both code and game theory are not being fully explored (consider the DAO itself was studied for months and much was missed, this has been a matter of days and is much more complicated since it's protocol wide and not a single contract). This fork in particular is unprecedented in that no one has ever tried a contentious hard fork before, so it's unpredictable. It's just a huge risk that doesn't seem worth it. if we blow this, we aren't going to recover. Second, here you have real people wanting to continue using the other chain. It will likely have some economic value (all it takes is one minor exchange to treat it like an alt coin, and they do that a lot), and relatively higher mining rewards (lower difficulty) will incentive economic activity.  It's hard to say you will never change your mind and want to return it, and will not be upset if you've been robbed there.

"You are really evil with your irresponsible FUD (or is it mental limitation?). You would need to first transfer from Account 1 to Account 2 on chain X, then from Account 1 to Account 3 on chain Y. You present the solution yourself (except that both TXs should be broadcast simultaneously on the two chains, not first one and then the other) and then you still say it's impossible - how disgusting! You need to do this only ONCE (whereas ""you"" can be an exchange or private person). If it doesn't succeed because of the evil automated hypothetical replay bot, you just try again UNTIL you succeed. From that moment on you have your funds split and don't need to worry any more about replays in the other chain, for all TXs building on top of Account 2 or 3. If you say it will never succeed then tell me how should the replay bot behave if you replay your own tx (1 to 2 and 1 to 3) on both chains simultaneously (i.e. in both chains you broadcast both competing TXs simultaneously)!? How should the replay bot make sure both chains accept the same TX in the same block, all the time? It can't, because it depends on the miners! So you have a 50% chance of success each trial. After 20 tials (or 20 blocks, i.e. < 5min) your chance of success is already >99.9999%. Stop spreading these lies, you are disqulifying yourself!

"My disclosure. [...] I've been working on the DAO since the very early days Then you should know better and not spread FUD! If the exchanges put their on-chain funds to different addresses on both chains after the HF BEFORE re-opening the client withdrawal function, your replay attack becomes impossible! And do not say that the exchanges can't do it! It may fail theoretically if they try once to put their funds on different addresses on the two chains, but they can try multiple times and WILL succeed eventually, and only afterwards they reopen withdrawal function! To clarify: They could even replay their own tx on the other chain! In this case there'll be a 50% probability to fail or succeed in splitting their funds on different addresses on different chains. But they can try as often as they want. Eventually they will succeed, and only afterwards (and after many confirmations) they'll reopen withdrawal function. edit: the detailed  ELI5 explanation here .",t3_4t2jfq,Amichateur
"Valid concern IMO. And I'm with you in preferring a ""freeze-fork"". Note that the hard-fork refund dapp  has already been deployed . New-to-old replays of transactions to  WitdrawDAO.withdraw()  will fail (as  WithdrawDAO  probably won't have any balance, and will  throw  upon trying to execute  msg.sender.send(balance) ). If I understand correctly (EDIT: nope, see  comment ), transactions from contract-based wallets can be replayed endlessly, since  their nonce doesn't increase . So on the ""old"" chain, such contract-based wallets could be drained to zero. Miners profit most from this, since they get paid (burned gas) for executing known-to-throw txs... Except they don't even have to execute them, they're known-to-throw. :) (Unless, of course, someone deposits to  WithdrawDao  by calling  withdraw()  from an account that doesn't have any DAO tokens, and attaching ether to that... Down the rabbit hole goes.) This is just one example, probably not that interesting for a lot of people. However, this is also the reason why  no exchange should run  nodes on  markets for both networks  (EDIT: with deposit/withdraw capability). If, say, Eve sells all her ETH1, buys up ETH2, then withdraws ETH2 to her external account, then she can replay this tx on the ETH1 network - even though on the exchange's books, she no longer holds any ETH1. It makes sense to sell the ""expensive"" one and buy the ""cheaper"" one, since that way she'll end up with a higher absolute number of ETHn.",t3_4t2jfq,veoxwmt

"If there is a fork happening, it's in everybody's interest to kill the minority branch as fast as possible. Let me ask this question differently: If the fork is happening, why vote anyway? Obviously because it's at the will of the miners. Satoshi Nakamoto and the creators of Ethereum had a specific algorithm in mind to ensure secure consensus of our blockchain. Non-quorum voting like the systems put in place by the top three pools break this algorithm. This doesn't have to be the case. As a community we can still uphold the integrity of our consensus mechanism, the only thing keeping our blockchain safe. I know that my opinion on whether or not to fork doesn't matter, and the pool takes no stance on whether the fork should be enacted. However, we see the current climate is treating some pool miners unfairly and we're trying to give them a place where their vote matters. In future forks this pool will serve not only voters who vote no but every miner who cares about the health of our network and it's consensus mechanism, no matter the direction of their vote. We encourage voting in either direction, but we want to ensure the voting process is upheld correctly. They want to maintain two competitive Ethereum blockchains? This won't be an issue as that's not how the new version of go-ethereum works. We're running the new version but will not vote for the fork. If the fork prevails, the network will automatically switch to the new version for every user of our pool, regardless of our user's vote. We believe this is 100% within the core beliefs of our pool (to vote for forks, honestly and respectfully to the will of our users) and we believe this is healthy for the Ethereum network as a whole.

It reminds me of the Bernie Madoff scandal and how, if possible, something like this could have helped investors with gaining back at least a portion of their money. Now it's not even in the same ballpark, and was a fraud that was enacted over the course of many years, but still, a system such as ours gives off alarms much earlier in the detection of such fraud happening in the moment, but to be able to freeze the perpetrators funds and (possibly?) return them is monumental for financial institutions running in the near future. I don't fully understand the ethics of why a HF is bad, I am trying to, but from my side as purely an investor in Ethereum I see this as a safeguard and makes me more confident in the structure as a whole. I trust the miners with their majority rule because they have a more financial outlook on the system as a whole. The hardcore anti-Fork crowd comes off as petty and more akin to that of religious zealots when it comes to the sanctity of the blockchain. The facts to me show that this is all an experiment and to deny trying historical things like this because 'Purity' is tarnished, seems irresponsible to the experiment. Plus, I'd like to see the whales that have invested in theDAO get their money back and plant their trust even further, possibly even reinvest more in the near future. As disclosure I invested around 86 eth into theDAO, It's a very small portion of my portfolio, and I championed 'burning' all the funds in theDAO (just check my post history) in the beginning just so that the thief would not get away with what was stolen. The HF has more of a beneficial leaning for me, so that the larger whales can grow with us, instead of feeling ripped off. of course they don't all understand what they were getting involved with, but returning money back after such a crisis says 10x more. all my opinion of course.",t3_4pox4g,happythots
"I see this as a safeguard and makes me more confident in the structure as a whole This is a bit of the problem. There won't be any incentive to do well-written contracts anymore because people will think that they will get a bailout every time the intention of contract doesn't match the code. In some cases it's impossible to know what the real intention of the contract was, so we have to trust the code and nothing else. And if Ethereum gets big in the future these things will happen all the time, and it won't be possible to bailout every time. So what makes you think that you're more entitled to get this money back than future users? I'm not 100% against a HF though, I'm just stating the arguments I can think of. I doubt it will have that much of an effect because the language will probably be safer, hopefully using functional programming and pi-calculus, eliminating many of these common errors.",t3_4pox4g,PooSham

"See twitter thread: https://twitter.com/mwilcox/status/855291714277326848 The whole multi-legged twitter thread (from April) is pretty interesting, but Mark's comments (and article hyperlinked above) on the trade-offs of on-chain versus off-chain transactions and the nature of blockchains and smart contracts is really interesting. I didn't reply to him at the time (was travelling, I think), but he's recently retweeted and it got me thinking again. I don't want this to descend into some pointless Bitcoin vs Ethereum slanging match, but his observations are not without merit and I think they deserve a well-thought-through response. So what are our best collective counter-arguments to Mark's points here? There are obviously some trade-offs along the spectrum here.   It's not black-and-white.",t3_6ii316,bobsummerwill
"Well let's keep this as simple as possible because there's a lot of ""intellectual"" ideas presented. Sifting through all of the chaff I find the key flaw in the argument is his reference to smart contracts being ""part of the network"" and outside of individual control. Smart contracts are not part of the consensus network. In fact they ARE a client and as separate from the consensus network as every other client. To put it plainly, smart contracts are automated clients programmed to produce an output desired by the human client that created it. The ""network"" as his alluding to defines it, is still only interested in the output, the smart contracts are immutable.",t3_6ii316,Hackdom
"Contracts aren't a client - that's exactly my point. If all validators agree, they can manipulate the state. If the state isn't fungible (every bit is dependent on every other bit) then it's open to attack by the validator set and there's no way to escape since the entire protocol was tied to a particular set of validators.",t3_6ii316,mwilcox
Every function is a linear transformation. If output x is transformed into output y and every output is valid with a signature how do you conclude the state isn't fungible?,t3_6ii316,Hackdom
Because the validators can make biased decisions to edit one part of the state and not another  http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds/,t3_6ii316,mwilcox
"This works both ways too - the validators stop you from modifying an agreement that you should be legally allowed to modify (again, take the DAO example, where those who held DAO tokens should have been allows to agree to place restrictions on the behaviour of the agreement they were party to without having to convince the miners to HF). It grants control over arbitrary things to validators while removing control from those who legally hold it.",t3_6ii316,mwilcox
"I suppose the DAO can and will be picked on until the viability of Ethereum becomes strong enough to put that event in the context it deserves, growing pains in a revolutionary technology. But to say the ""validators"" made an arbitrarily biased decision with no questions asked also glosses over the fact that the nodes could participate in ETC or ETH, that was collectively their decision. I could bake a vanilla cake, not like the way it turned out, then bake a chocolate cake. When you show up though, you can pick whichever cake you want to eat.",t3_6ii316,Hackdom
"Sorry but that's no excuse. This is not a young technology - Bitcoin has been running with no such attack for years. The incentives are much different under PoS than PoW but purely on PoW ethereum's design led not just to the event occuring but also its un-do. Any scenario where a majority of validators agree that removing state is valuable, it's likely to happen, since small holder will have to weigh up the value of that particular piece of state versus going with the crowd.",t3_6ii316,mwilcox
This is not a young technology yeah it is.,t3_6ii316,texture
"Ok, I see your assessments on 1) loss of control 2) Bitcoin's natural protection against that attack and 3) the leverage gained by the larger influencers. My contention against removing on-chain opcode remains in the fact that contracts are created to act within a certain set of rules and all accounts know those rules. Loss of control is assigned, not automatic. Contributors could've decided not to send output to that contract if they wanted a way to pull it back within a certain set of parameters, but they agreed to the automated contract the way it was written and understood. So then if they AGREED to that, it removes all grounds to suggest a hardfork would be your contention. To which I respond that the contract did not operate the way it was meant because of human error, not logic error. Which leads to my contention on point two. Bitcoin has been around for years, sure, and it's simple once POW has been solved. Ethereum is more complex, the complexity should not be cause to abandon the project. It's another challenge to be solved in this progress. As far as point three, when there are no rules obviously broken, I contend that no influencer will be able to move the blockchain in an unreasonable direction without destroying viability. Economics decides when it's appropriate to fork or not, just like economics is the only barrier to a 51% attack.",t3_6ii316,Hackdom
"Sorry but code is not a legal contract. As the DAO showed, it's the social contract of intent that matters and it's highly likely that any arbitrarily complex compiled code expresses the entire agreement in totality. Just because you blame the user for using buggy code doesn't mean the contract isn't buggy. Should the DAO users have lost all their money? Should non-DAO ETH holders have had to hard fork? As  /u/Savage_X  explained below,  users  shouldn't have to personally be experts on debugging compiled machine code in order to use them. Economics decides when it's appropriate to fork or not, just like economics is the only barrier to a 51% attack. Agreed. And the economics of ethereum mean that the state is there for the taking for a validator set if it's an economically good decision. They can even rewrite history if they like since there's no real cost to rewriting the chain. So let's come back to your first point. They agreed to the contract  as written . If the validator set collectively decides to attack the chain and rewrite  your contract  and it has someone elses money in it what are you gonna do about it? Are you liable for the guys funds? Assume that miners will perform any attack that doesn't harm them. With traditional transactions, they won't steal people money because that'd mean other miners might steal  their  money! There's co-dependence. It's a common misconception that a 51% and a hard fork are the same thing. A successful 51% attack results in a double-spend of the attackers own money. A hard fork results in the creation of a new chain that runs on different rules. Protecting against a 51% attack is very very different from protecting against a hard fork. Under PoW, an ETH/ETC split can happen. Under PoS, it can't. The protocol is defined as whatever the majority of its holders decide it to be - an effective  drag-along right . These systems  must  be designed with attacks in mind. It's not about whether an attack will happen but  how they react when they are attacked !",t3_6ii316,mwilcox
"Drag-along right Drag-along right (DAR) is a legal concept in corporate law. The right assures that if the majority shareholder sells their stake, minority holders are forced to join the deal. This right protects majority shareholders. A drag-along right gives the investing shareholder the right to force the other investor(s) to exit, should the investing shareholder exit, again, usually on the same price and terms.

"I agree with the points and I will follow up with something not as verbose or contentious because I'm tired and most likely will only increase the gaps in my arguments. Does there exist a state in which all computer logic is perfectly executed as expected? Yes. Will that state be achieved? No. Why? Because we choose advancement once we've reached an acceptable level of risk in the current state. Should $100M be plowed into a single contract right now? That's a moral/subjective question that everyone has their own opinion on. Why? Because the current level of risk on Ethereum is acceptable to some and not acceptable to others. Can we achieve an acceptable level of risk with opcode on-chain? Considering the benefits to logic being executed on the public chain, I believe it is both obtainable and should be pursued. Are we there now? No. You may have some of the battle now, but I surmise Ethereum wins the war.",t3_6ii316,Hackdom
"I do think that this is one of the basic lessons of The DAO. That a contract should not hold enough value to make it worth modifying the state by a majority of validators. Regardless of the intention of the modification - be it theft or protecting against theft. There is definitely a cost to the network to fork the state that is borne by all the participants in the network, and we should be striving to make sure that no contract contains more value than that cost so failures remain localized. It's hard to quantify those things exactly, but we crossed that line with The DAO, and obviously bad things happened.",t3_6ii316,Savage_X
Unfortunately the exact opposite also applies where low-value state is seen as a tax on the network. It's impossible to separate attacks like the DAO from similar state-modifying attacks that have also occured afterwards:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5es5g4/a_state_clearing_faq/,t3_6ii316,mwilcox
"When it comes to dealing with money, we definitely want control flow to be performed on the client, not the network, since you should get to decide when you spend your own money. That means that once a transaction is published, its behaviour should already have been determined. Any dependencies required to produce a valid state transition should already have been executed on the client by the time you publish. Whereas an ethereum smart contract has been delegated control over money, the control flow is now public, and open to attack. Only the input and the resulting state transition is dataflow. I think this paragraph kind of sums up a lot. From a computer science view, I agree with this. Bitcoin is more secure by nature and has less of an attack surface. From a practical view, this is meaningless for 99% of the people out there. They do not need that level of security, and they are not competent enough to secure their inputs to that level even if they did need it. Pushing more complexity to the users seems great to a Bitcoin core dev, but for a normal user, that is terrifying. By placing transactions into valid-or-invalid buckets, making transactions blind to the rest of the state, and being explicit about the value of a transaction is that the whole graph becomes extremely parallelisable and scalable Oh, the irony :) Pragmatically, Bitcoin businesses struggle to do any kind of monetization on the main chain, so they are largely trying to influence it to add new features and scalability to second layer networks that can be more easily monetized. However, these secondary layers are very insecure and centralized. If they become widely used, they lesson the valuable properties of the primary protocol layer. Ethereum on the other hand has huge amounts of potential for monetization on the primary public chain. This is going to provide a lot more motivation for on-chain scaling. Its kind of a strange kind of juxtaposition given the nature of the two networks.",t3_6ii316,Savage_X
Bitcoin businesses are called miners and they have no problem with monetisation.,t3_6ii316,mwilcox
Seems like that is causing some conflict though. Bitcoin core dev says  that mining has profits at all is a bug. My long term theory is that mining operations will eventually be run at cost or even at loss in order for more profitable businesses to either protect the protocol from changes that would harm them or to influence changes that increase their profitability.,t3_6ii316,Savage_X

"You're right that there are two attacks here. I think moving the tokens out at the end to re-start the attack was very clever. That concept needs a name so that developers can start thinking about it when reviewing code. How about ""move the ball""? Zingy names aren't quite as descriptive, but they definitely can stick with you. Anyway, for purposes of this thread, I will call it ""move the ball"". Because of the way the transactions work, I think we can safely say that the exploit wallet was instrumented to take advantage of a  move-the-ball vulnerability. If not, the attacker would have had to go obtain more tokens somehow. In this case, they just reused their own tokens over and over.",t3_4onbkj,vessenes
So the move-the-ball vulnerability was found first by the attacker?  Is there any way we can know this conclusively?  Perhaps the attacker initially thought that 7500 ETH would be sufficient to scare people and then later found this additional vector? Understanding if the move-the-ball vector was found before or after the other vector is critical to understanding the attacker I think.  If the move-the-ball vector was found before the attack then it means it wasn't an opportunistic vector but a planned vector to destroy the DAO. Maybe if there was no move-the-ball vector there would be no attack by this person.  Unless they could make major news headlines it wouldn't be worth it for them.  I think this means that this person is extremely intelligent.  It also means that they were most likely following the DAO very closely and most likely in the different slack / discussion forums. This allows you to create a profile that perhaps less than 50 people are capable of fitting.,t3_4onbkj,joshuad31
"No, the contract was definitely instrumented to recycle the tokens from day one.",t3_4onbkj,vessenes

"Do you have any time for more insights into Implication 1: The DAO is Now Confused? Specifically, do you have any idea what the ratio would be if a user split into a child DAO right now? Same as current? Higher? Lower?",t3_4onbkj,insomniasexx
1:100,t3_4onbkj,goldcakes
"Considering the main DAO is no longer 1:100, it is impossible a child dao would have 1:100",t3_4onbkj,insomniasexx
So if DAO still thinks it owns 11mil ETH - will the current splits be at 1:100?,t3_4onbkj,vicnaum
Yea... Check the splitDAO a couple of hours ago...,t3_4onbkj,goldcakes
"Nice analysis! Some thoughts: Right now, as of writing, theDAO thinks it has 3.5mm more coins than it has. There's some discussion as to what this means, but almost certainly it means other splits and reward calculations are going to be incorrect. If you do a split now, the real amount of ether will be used (that is, excluding the stolen ones). So you will no longer get a 1:100 exchange rate. All calls that send to untrusted address should have a gas limit There may be a problem with this. Suppose I use my own contract, which exceeds the gas limit. If so, I will never be able to withdraw my ether. They may get stuck forever. And it is hard to know this for sure until I test it first time.",t3_4onbkj,LarsPensjo
"So the attacker uploaded a wallet contract that calls splitDAO, and used that as his withdraw address? Is that wallet contract the ""new child dao"" that currently holds all the drained ETH? Id like to see the code for the attack contract",t3_4onbkj,pinhead26
"You can't.  The code is at  http://etherscan.io/address/0xf835a0247b0063c04ef22006ebe57c5f11977cc4  and  https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0ee9db1a9e07ca63e4ff0d5fb6f86bf68d47b89 .  You can view the binary and disassembled assembly version there.  Decompiling to Solidity is impossible, as semantic information is lost in the compilation to a binary. There are people I know of working on analyzing that code right now, so there will be more public information in a few days at the latest (if nobody beats us to it, I have an unrelated work deadline to deal with for the next few days).",t3_4onbkj,AlLnAtuRalX
Ok so these little bastards triggered the recursive withdraw... But the actual ETH goes to a new ETH account (child dao) created by the original dao?,t3_4onbkj,pinhead26
"Correct, because the actual function that executes multiple times is TokenCreation.createTokenProxy, which moves ETH to a child DAO (and the child DAO is created by the splitDAO function using the createNewDAO method, which means it has the same code as the original DAO).",t3_4onbkj,AlLnAtuRalX
"So maybe this is a dumb question but why? Why isn't there just a simple ""cash out"" function that just sends ETH to a users  address?",t3_4onbkj,pinhead26
"Probably mostly to create some sort of penalty whereby you need to lock funds to withdraw.  That allows reacting to events like this, and more than that it disincentivizes investment by people who think there is ""no risk"" to investing because they can withdraw at any time, making the total investment a more accurate reflection of the serious money at stake.",t3_4onbkj,AlLnAtuRalX
"I would propose it's because TheDAO folks thought they were smarter than they are, and wanted to get fancy. The codebase would be less than half the size if people could only sell their tokens, or burn them for book value and refund of ether on the books.",t3_4onbkj,vessenes

Nope.  That's covered in my writeup  here  (Ctrl-F Step 4a).,t3_4onbkj,AlLnAtuRalX

"One important community discussion point is to determine in what way we should give the DAO token holders back their Ether. Releasing 11,538,166 Ether all at the same time on the market has never been tested before. However gradual release of funds has been the way miners introduce to the market ever since Ethereum was created. If we release all the tokens in one big lump sum then we will see a huge and sudden supply shock on the market. Maybe it would be a better idea if we release the funds very gradually, what if for example we put all the funds in a smart-contract, but limit the withdrawal rate to 5 Ether per newly mined block. That way the supply will be spaced out at the same rate as regular mining supply increase. The coding required for this should only be one line of code, so it does not introduce any added risks. This means with 11,538,166 Ether needed to be distributed it will take 2,307,633 blocks, this will take about 374 days, so roughly 1 year. This would mean that someone with 12000 DAO tokens would be able to claim his 120 Eth back in instalments of about 10 Ether per month, or about 0.3 Ether per day. For the long term investors among Dao holders this hold will not make any difference, but for the panic sellers it would greatly reduce the selling load. I think with a release model like this the miners are much more likely to vote in favour of the hardfork because the risk of a supply shock will be migrated. It will simply be something like: maxwithdrawal = ((blocknumber-startingblocknumber)x5x(UserEther/11538166))-PreviousWithdrawalbyUser; so Imagine someone has 120 total Ether in the contract, and tries to withdrawal after 1 month (185142 blocks): 185142x5x(120/11538166)-0 = 9.627630595711658 So the user can withdrawal approximately 10 Ether per month",t3_4qytqb,oneaccountpermessage

Don't you think releasing such a huge amount of ethers in one big lump could also bee seen as market manipulation? Theses 12 millions of ether were not suposed to hit the exchanges for a very long time.,t3_4qytqb,alexEnShort

Very nice summary  /u/koeppelmann Just one small correction. The second important date is July 27. That is the first date where ETH could leave the darkDAO (hack on June 16 + 27 days creation period + 14 days proposal period). The Dark DAO attacker and curator are not the same person. So the Dark DAO can not take its money out by a proposal. The only way would be to split again. So in short this means: June 16 + 27 days creation period + 7 days split debate period + 27 days new creation period + 14 days proposal period. This would put the money coming out of the Dark DAO on the 30th of August. Ofcourse there are 3 more dark DAOs whose curator may also be malicious so we should only consider the 30th of August as the date for the big dark DAO and do different calculations for the other ones.,t3_4qytqb,LefterisJP
"The main concern here is whether proposals made before the actual ""attack"" are still considered valid. Since all funds were drained from the original dao and its integrity disrupted proposals #1- #77 that were made within the original dao contract might not be subjected to the execution within the contracts created in proposals #78 and #99. If so then no eth could be taken out of the dao on 07.15.2016.",t3_4qytqb,heglassedme
"I'm just going to post this one last message on the topic, I feel we all each are starting to understand each other's positions. We may disagree but at least we can't say we didn't try to understand each others position to the best of our ability. I understand why people want to do the hard fork, really I get the point of bailing people who lost out to slockit's incompetence. A lot of them believed in Ethereum and wanted to support it. I think where we are not connecting maybe is: we either have (a) a network capable of running unstoppable applications or (b) a network that can stop an application if enough political capital is gained. People here are proposing this may be the foundation of a new model for an internet interface, web3, I'm not a big fan of the name and think a better client could be made and I have been working on one. I agree that there is a potential for a new way to develop a conception of how the internet can be structured in a more decentralized way. If we are going to agree this could possibly be that, a new possibly improved form of internet. It must not be allowed to have its applications be stopped and we can not start putting political code in the protocol. If this is a new internet, ask yourself would we ever let someone modify the TCP/IP protocol to specifically add in politics that benefit a select group of people? Even if it was a new concept, that would not justify building in censorship tools. We should be equally as outraged at the concept with Ethereum if anyone is going to take it seriously. If this is as important as everyone here agrees it is, we should not be compromising something with this much importance's integrity so quickly into the life of it. Yes, 150 million is a lot of money, but please let me try to explain why its not meaningless loss. It shows Ethereum's price to manipulate the blockchain is above 150 million. You must have more than 150 million and hopefully much much more , you can't change anything for political reasons and the economic wall functions to prevent changes to the ledger. The blockchains value relates to this being very high because more money can be safely stored. In the case of Ethereum,   this becomes proof the design requires more than 150 million to manipulate it, which would be assuring everyone they could trust it for more serious things, like a possibly a decentralized news organization or other structures that would require a lot of trust. Honestly if you want a network with a flexible database, it may be better to do a delegated proof of stake and have a permission DB. It would be much faster, easier to shard and more efficient than the current version of Ethereum, Ethereum is interesting because it is using a blockchain. The blockchain's entire design is to create an economic wall to prevent anyone from modifying the ledger so we can all trust it. Everyone regardless of culture can trust they can use it and its equitable as we can engineer it. It remains a country neutral global computer that can be something to connect everyone regardless of culture. Yes, it sucks that ""bad"" guys go free, but its the same sacrifice in a modern justice system, we have to allow some guilty people walk to ensure no one is wrongly punished. We don't want to even give the chance for a contract being wrongly punished and shut down because the majority of shareholders want to program their political system/beliefs into the protocol level of the new internet. It should just be a piece of engineering, politics should be on a higher level. What makes Bitcoin so valuable is that its not manipulatable, which for a currency also means not counterfeitable. We can calculate right now roughly how much money it would take to try to attack the network based on electricity use. It is a very large number and growing. If we do this we are setting the price to change the ledger in Ethereum, and thats just a bad use of a blockchain. If we hard fork, we are setting a price, even if it changes over time, we are saying if you gain x amount of political capital you can change the ledger and add politics, and that level of politics should not be built into the protocol.",t3_4qytqb,[deleted]

"/u/dnivi3     /u/baddogesgotoheaven You guys are mistaking the  technically possible  for the  probable.   Consider that in the US democratic system, voters can amend the constitution to remove the rights of blacks to vote.  Such a thing is  technically possible , but  extraordinarily unlikely.   But now let's say that we actually did amend the constitution to remove the right of a really tiny demographic (like people on the suspected terrorist list) to vote.  Than we amend the constitution to remove the rights of Muslims in general to vote.  Now the odds of amending the constitution to remove the rights of blacks to vote would be higher. Precedent matters for 2 reasons. A. It  changes  the makeup of the community.  Some people who are firmly anti-HF will leave forever, thus the remaining ethereum community will be more amenable to HFs in general. B. It psychologically changes peoples' view of what ethereum is and should be.

With ethereum I know that if I code a potato like the dao then it's my fault because I did a shit job. That I can live with because it's a controllable risk (a known unknown). If politics start creeping in, in the form of forks etc this is too much risk for me. No sane person would disagree. The whole point of the ethereum blockchain is the code is the contract. If that ceases to be the case then there is no point anymore. Might as well use a rdbms, at least that way when you're unhappy with the outcome it's easy to revert.",t3_4qytqb,rorykoehler

"Let's see, Foundation which is supposed to be independent, lends tacit endorsement to DAO - it fails. proposal to attack the DAO by the 'good' guys to drain the funds was compromised because a 'bad' guy also participated softfork is developed, fully deployed, and triggered.

Certain devs, responsible for clients are known to hold large amounts of theDAO, with their interests still not disclosed. The hard-fork is known to be wrong from a technical perspective - fixing application layer bugs with protocol change, and then getting miners to undermine the protocol. And there is the pressure of a ticking clock My questions are, How confident are you personally about this process?

"So, to be clear, I never invested in the DAO. Given that, both the choice of the soft fork and the hard fork make me regret my decision to invest in ethereum at all. From what I can tell, it was a contract at fault rather than the currency itself. If this is correct, then I'm sorry, but screw you all? Invalidating some currency transactions due to the fact that a contract is flawed sounds kind of sketchy to me. I totally understand where you all are coming from; I'd hate to lose a bunch of money because of some asshole, but by forking the code in order to recover the currency, it shakes the very foundation of it's existence; how can I know that this won't occur in the future to invalidate some transaction I've made? I don't mean to be facetious; if someone has a legitimate way to prove this will never happen again, please let me know! At the current point I'm severely regretting my decision to invest in the currency (sadly just days before the attack; I've lost a bit of money despite not investing in the DAO!) and considering cutting my losses and just reverting to bitcoin.",t3_4qytqb,mrq02
"I mean, I must be missing something, right? Because if a contract can be made invalid by code, then no contract is safe; it can be invalidated at a later date.

Why would anyone care about contracts that are valid if and only if the creators of ethereum allow them? Might as well stick with fiat currency.",t3_4qytqb,mrq02
"The key point you're missing is that it's up to the users to pick which chain they want to support. Creators can't possibly dictate a hard fork. The hard fork will be a community decision above all. Your contracts are valid in all cases except the one in which the community feels threatened by them and struggles two weeks to decide that their best interest is to avoid them. Having said that, forking creates two chains meaning nobody actually invalidates your contract, it still works exactly as programmed.

Additionally, much of the value of the crypto depends on  future  development by the devs.  If we know the devs will only work on one chain, the other has very little value.  Lastly, ETH only has value if we can exchange it or spend it.  If the economically important nodes (mostly exchanges today) all favor one chain, than users pretty much have to follow that one.",t3_4qytqb,asdoihfasdf9239

Great write-up though I would be interested to hear how you think a bitcoin hardfork could change balances without rolling back the blockchain.,t3_4qytqb,Dabauhs
"They would just create a transaction to transfer balance from attacker's utxo to their address and agree (hard fork) to accept it without a signature. Edit: Practically, this wouldn't help, because attacker would most likely just move funds to a different address, moments before hard fork would activate. It would only work, if attacker's funds were frozen with special timelock script. Frozen funds are the reason we don't need a rollback, not Ethereum vs Bitcoin technology.",t3_4qytqb,GloomyOak

"The previous third option of a soft fork had some problems that made it dangerous to execute. nobody explained why the ddos attack will be ""mathematically"" executable?",t3_4qytqb,malefizer
"One of the basic features of Ethereum is the principle that if you want a miner to execute your smart contract code you have to pay that miner to do so using Gas. The mechanism for doing this is to include some Ether in the transaction that triggers the smart contract code for the miner to take when he incorporates that transaction into a verified block. The goal of the soft fork was to censor any transaction that would call certain functions on TheDAO to prevent the hacker from extracting funds or performing certain other actions. Since a transaction can include smart contract code and smart contracts are turing complete, it is necessary to execute a transaction to determine exactly what it is going to do. Ie, before we know whether a transaction is to be censored we have to first ""try it out."" But since censored transactions don't get added to the blockchain, the miner can't accept any payment for trying it out. So it's possible to flood the transaction pool with transactions bearing big expensive-to-execute smart contracts that trigger the censorship code. It's ""free"" to send these transactions (none of the Ether you attach to them as payment will actually be claimed) but the miners still have to run them. That makes for a great DDOS vector. You do something cheap to make the other guy do something expensive.",t3_4qytqb,FaceDeer

Only the DAO.,t3_4qytqb,LarsPensjo

"Where can I find out more about why the soft fork wouldn't work? Specifically this: An attack could have created lots of transactions that would have looked valid from the outside but if miners would execute them they would eventually realize that those transactions contain a reduction of balance of a DAO address which is not valid under the soft fork rules. Usually transactions that fulfill some basic, easy to verify standards can be executed no matter what. Even if an exception occurs the gas would been paid. This makes it usually costly to create spam transactions. However, transactions that are excluded by the soft fork rules can not be included in the blockchain and therefore an attacker would not have to pay the fee. Is there a more detailed discussion somewhere?",t3_4qytqb,bitcoind3

"most theft is inside job folks... Plus the hack may have been part of the code or contract.  read the article by Bloomberg out today  http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-17/blockchain-company-s-smart-contracts-were-dumb  They make the case that it is a feature in the smart contract and though courts may find otherwise...getting to court with enough evidence may be tough...especially if the actor or actors are on the inside.  So the real possibility exists that the hacker was just using the full power of the code/ contract available to him.  It makes sense to think this is someone with intimate knowledge of the features.  And also nobody has yet mentioned how the DAO tokens may stand to rise in ""value"" causing an actual suppression of eth ""value"".  And when you consider that the dao fundraising was on par to the market share of the eth at the time of closing it stands to be quite a suppression possibility depending on what happens with the dao.  Obviously there have been issues there but still you see how many eth holder could have fear who are wise enough to see they may not have enough DAO to balance the possible suppression effect on their eth.  Therefore eth holders who see this will certainly want to buy up lots of DAO.  I will let smarter people explain this but I do understand the concept.  It is when a platform has 'currencies' running on it, the fuel is actually suppressed in value that services the 'currency'.  This was V.B.'s original concept remember to run contracts as a fuel. Notice how the suggestion of working with the hackers is being pushed as the best idea.  Also notice how some of the first comments where to blame the investors for not knowing what they invested into.  Victim blaming is the tool of the tyrant.  I am not saying those comments are not true but it also could whitewash a possible theft/ feature/ event.  Ethereum devs are obviously smart and seem very good but they also probably realize the world we live in, what they are competing against and working with to survive in such a place.   It is not all unicorns out there people.  Folk are nasty...especially in crypto and banking.  Now they are engaged to each other.  It is the wild west as stated on eth's webpage.  They are not green when they went into this.  They are positioned to be the banker coin and this event will not stop the banks from using eth but it may stop average folks from using bitcoin. It's not a bug it's a feature - ever hear that before? Disclosure I have approx 8 eth and 932 DAO on a jaxx wallet Also I am not accusing anyone, nor do I have any opinion, just pulling together news from today that supports this opinion above.

Inside job on the organization that purportedly has no insiders. Oh the batshit.,t3_4olvfr,theTBTFdao
"So now we cannot use the word inside?  I think the readers deserve more credit.  But let's humor you: So nice catch your right it is decentralized and since they say they are decentralized and have consensus protocals for change then everyone who ever touched the project is completely not involved and doesn't know any hackers or bad people and never would leave that feature in there on purpose.  There is no inside so it cannot be an inside job.  I want to live on your planet. However it is possible that someone left the ""feature"" in there or was busy or underestimated the danger, was threatened, etc., etc., it was then disclosed  PUBLICLY  and then another walks away with the booty. Maybe they could not fix the problem in the contract without breaking the contract and that does not sound good to say out loud but let's face it the DAO was having some issues that maybe were not getting fixed anytime soon.  Maybe this will make the system better.  But since it is decentralized one person cannot ""do"" anything - enter the hacker (aka problem solver).  Maybe the solution was designed before the hack was begun.  I am full of theories and that is all they are.  Do you want me to be sorry I can think and that I do not trust people because that is why I like crypto including eth and why I like what VB invented.  So I hope he can handle my comments I think he can.  Thanks I think it is a test of experimental software with real peoples money.  And people do not know what they are doing with DAO and time will tell if it is decentralized or not.  And even a decentralized group will have a leader even if only temporarily.  These are not robots who wrote the contract and code they are people.  Can you audit their thoughts?  Did you vote on every line in that contract in true decentralize fashion?  Why did the decentralized community not write their own contract before they invested into it?  It is worth considering since that would be a truly decentralized process and it would take forever but at least you would have consensus each step of the way.  Maybe I should keep my mouth shut because I really do not care I just think people need to think more.  Hope is a dangerous thing",t3_4olvfr,Bitbobb

There was definitely too much FOMO and too much excitement about the new, and these experiments should have started smaller but the tone of the criticism really grates me. Maybe failure with most of the money returned will be good so we can experiment with 20 or 30 or 50 different types of DAOs. Some with liquid democracy, some structured similar to the failed one, some with very rigid rules and others with more fluid dynamics. Clearly there are many out there like me who want to run a more altruistic DAO with the goal of building the ecosystem first and the secondary goal of profit, and others who want a purely profit focused DAO. The biggest mistake was rushing, and I think that was probably caused by slock.it wanting (or needing) funding, and also wanting to build this great new thing.

If the same DAO was designed without the split and with the same curator system (so quasi-centralized but in a democratic semi-trust fashion) we'd probably be cruising along with 20-40$ million and everything would be fine. On the other hand, if we survive this, that topline number of $150-160 million got eyeballs on this in a way nothing would, and the number of exciting projects being proposed in such a short time to get their hands on that sweet DAO wad was frankly exciting as hell.

"Hi there, I'm the professor to whom you said ""grow the fuck up,"" because I called for the community to censure the people who got us into this mess. I have seen your reddit comments on this board before, and they are remarkably on point, except this one. So let me fill in the backstory of how we got to the point where we are at, and why this comment is uncharacteristically way off base. You will recall that Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir and I were originally very concerned about attacks on The DAO. Our paper named at least nine different attacks, and called for a moratorium until at least the most egregious ones could be fixed. We did not know at that time that a hacker would come along and use some of the vulnerabilities we identified, as well as others we had not foreseen. I worked around the clock to get our cautionary paper out. This required actual, tangible, personal sacrifice. But I felt compelled, because I could see that the DAO code was not where it needed to be, and that a DAO failure could be catastrophic not just for the DAO, but for eth, and maybe for cryptocurrencies or the idea of smart contracts. Yet when we disclosed these vulnerabilities, we faced immediate abuse from the SlockIt team. Stephan Tual posted that we were seeking attention, and Griff was abusive on two different occasions on a Skype channel. For reasons I don't understand, perhaps because I'm an academic and Stephan thinks I am an outsider (which is incorrect, we have been involved in eth before its official inception), the abuse has been specifically targeted towards me. I ignored this initial abuse because I happen to like Vitalik, Vlad, the rest of the Ethereum gang and care for Ethereum as a project. But after the hack occurred, Griff and Stephan went from just being abusive into defamatory accusations that are beyond the pale. I had had an internal conversation with a student where we had discussed the possibility of a reentrancy attack, and we wrongly concluded that splitDAO was not vulnerable (we were not alone in this: Stephan wrote at the time that the DAO was not vulnerable to reentrancy bugs). In the private channel where we were discussing how to respond to the hack, Stephan and Griff accused me of knowing but not disclosing the bug. This escalated to accusations that  I was the DAO hacker . Griff tried to boot me off of the channel, despite everything I had done to help. Christoph would apologize to me in private email, but Griff, who reports to him, was continually abusive. Some of you may have seen Vitalik's open support for researchers -- this was a direct reaction to the unprofessional conduct at SlockIt. Let me repeat:  I worked hard to help them and the community, and they responded by accusing me of a felony. I don't care about the straight up libel. What irks me is the SlockIt team's general assumption that I, and my colleagues, should work for free to fix their mistakes, that we are responsible and accountable to them even though we never performed an official review, and that, in general, the entire community owes it to the SlockIt team to make their project a financial success for them. You can all see where we are today. The SEC is most definitely going to be taking a closer look at smart contracts, the DAO hacker is still not fully contained, Ethereum is in the headlines, but for the wrong reasons. I am still very optimistic about eth's future, but what the SlockIt team put all of us through in their greed is unconscionable. It's in this context that I made the case to excise the bad code out of the blockchain, and to excise the bad apples from the community. Specifically, I mentioned Stephan and Griff, not Christoph -- I believe the article gets it wrong, or if I said Christoph at the talk, I misspoke. Currently, the offer on the table for people like Stephan is: "" heads I win, tails the community loses. "" He can overhype any broken product; he captures the upside if it works, and if it breaks, he gets a bailout. Faced with these odds, any rational person would come back again and again to the same trough and see what he can take away from the generous community. When an athlete is caught cheating in an event, we do not take away just the medal from that event. If we did, a cheater would have a positive expectation to win: if you get caught, you lose nothing, and with some probability, you make it big. This is why every professional society, from cyclists to bankers, places sanctions in place for actors who bring the bad kind of attention to that area. Doping cyclists don't just lose one single medal at the event in which they doped, they get a ban to think over what they did wrong. In many cases, that timeout is sorely needed: entitled people who believe that an entire community will hard fork the blockchain to make up for their mistakes as if this is a trivial thing, that experts to whom they have shown no respect will somehow work for free for them, need some time to get a bit of perspective before they collect more cash from the community with their next gig. So I stand by my decentralized, open call: in the Bitcoin world, we have seen the same actors come back repeatedly with scam variants. Unless we put some social measures in place, people can abuse a community repeatedly until they strike it rich. I think it's a proportionate and reasonable reaction to give people, who have caused this much heartache for this many people, some time to think over what happened. I saw this thread very late, so my response will not be seen by anyone, but regardless, I hope this clarifies my position.

The entire DAO project was rushed out the door too quickly: yes, they worked on it for six months, the commit history show that, but such a complex smart contract needed a long period of test with a lot less value in it. But that was probably not inline with Slock.it funding needs and timeline. A shame, because also Lefteris and Christoph reputation were/are at stake here, and I'm sure they are great programmers.

"You're still repeating the same nonsense Griff. I am no more anti-SlockIt than Vlad or Dino. We wrote that paper very carefully to spare you guys. Even now, I support a hard fork, which is the best possible outcome for your operation. I  thought  I had an exploit two days after the attacker started, but my team couldn't develop one. We tried 10 different things and gave up. We had no actionable exploit, so we had nothing to report besides Vessenes's post, which we had already passed along. Your behavior has been reprehensible. Acting like this to people who have come to your aid makes it far less likely that people will come to your aid, or in fact, get involved in ethereum. P.S. Cutting and pasting a discussion from a private security discussion channel is terrible form. But glad you did it, because everyone can see your behavior and my reaction.",t3_4pcsq8,el33th4xor
"Copying a private conversation from a secure channel onto reddit was a huge breach. It is a fact that you did cut&paste from a private channel to the public -- it's visible above. What you made public wasn't critical to the security of the DAO, but it was said in a channel with an expectation of privacy. You violated this. This is completely unacceptable, and it fractally contains all of the reasons for why SlockIt has failed. There are more productive things I need to do today, but for the last time, I will go through and comprehensively kill the bad ideas you keep repeating. First, if the participants cannot be assured that the channel is truly private, if they worry that someone will leak their conversations to the public, they will be leery of what they say. Security professionals, especially, will not want to operate in such an environment: what you deem non security critical to you might carry risks (e.g. it might be relevant in another context, it might carry reputational risk, etc), that you're not in a position to assess. This is why what you did is a major breach of trust. Second, you demand that we should share every half-baked idea we have with you, and simultaneously leak private conversations to the public. Those two things do not make sense together. No one will want to risk having their private conversations leaked to the public. You are doing the exact thing that I was worried about, validating the reasons why it would have been a bad idea to share anything except public statements with your team. Third, it betrays a self-centered world-view, where you feel you can unilaterally violate a contract. Despite your refusal to listen, everyone keeps telling you that the world does not revolve around you, Stephan, The DAO, or your need to get rich or be made whole. We are not playthings for you to manipulate. We are not here to serve you. My words aren't yours to carry, from one location to the next, without permission. Fourth, you keep repeating a falsehood, that you made up in your own mind, that I knew an exploit. ""I'm pretty sure"" is what I say when I have a hunch but am not entirely sure. My team worked on checking that hunch, and we did not have an exploit to report. What we had, Vessenes's post, we already had reported, and you guys had already checked the exact code around which I had my hunch. There was no more action item -- we did not have any more content to give you that you did not already have. You need to accept this bit of objective reality, and stop repeating a lie. Fifth, anyone who reads the transcript can see that I tried to direct you towards a mature mentor physically close to you, namely, Christoph. The word ""bait"" has no place in this discourse, and shows your continued disrespect. You need to learn to take responsibility for your actions: what you did was wrong. It wasn't prompted by me. I didn't ""bait"" you into doing whatever you did. You need to own your actions. They are not other people's fault. They are yours and yours alone. Finally, you do not want to ""collaborate"" with me or my team: you want us to serve you. This is evident from the way SlockIt lobbed false allegations at me and created a separate Skype channel, excluding me from it. You want me to work for you for free. Please read point #3 again, until it's clear to you that domain experts, DAO investors, eth holders, and others, aren't here to serve your selfish needs. Collaborations are two way streets. They start from a foundation of mutual respect. And you & Stephan have taken every opportunity to damage that. At this point, I'm almost convinced that SlockIt has made a command decision to deflect blame by creating online drama: Stephan and you are too savvy in marketing and know better, but have decided to use a public facedown with me as a diversionary tactic. This will not serve you well, you picked the wrong target. I happen to be a hard fork supporter, but if you continue to waste my time with repeats of the same falsehoods and entitled, self-centered thinking, I will revise my opinion. There are lots of different ways of doing hard forks, some of which leave SlockIt far worse off than others.

The only thing I'd say is that vitalik and vlad were apparently told rather than christoph. I assume that's a reflection of previous behaviour in response to security issues. I've also provided vlad (copied to christoph) with information for similar reasons, and had to bother gavin on father's day of all things with another possible issue because slock had lost the trust of other people in security (he took the time out and dealt with it totally professionally). This trust was lost due to previous actions, not flaws in the code. It was still ensured the white hat counter attack had what was needed but there is significant unease at emin being attacked and the general hubris, at least until Christoph's post here. a Also, posting 'private' convos to a public forum, even if a group security channel, is bad form.

""" I think this proves that writing reliable smart contracts is hard. If we want smart contracts to work, we have to put a lot of effort into making it easier. One thing I've been experimenting with at Ripple might be able to help. Instead of having a single transactor or a single contract, you have two. The first one produces the results and the second one confirms that the results don't violate invariants. You run the first piece of code and then you run the results of that code through the second piece of code. If the second piece rejects them, you don't allow any changes other than charging for the attempt. You have to make the second piece of code as simple and clear as possible, but also do enough checks that you get a real security benefit from it. That's not a trivial problem to solve, but it's simpler because that code can be small, entirely self-contained and straightforward. The only downside is that you have to make a tradeoff in what you check. Each thing you don't check is wiggle room for an attacker to do damage. Each thing you do check increases the potential attack surface of the second piece of code. Nevertheless, I think there are significant benefits to this approach because either an attacker cannot violate the basic invariants or the attacker has to ""line up"" flaws in both pieces of code.""

Or would each DAO require a custom fail-safe method (which means it would be harder to trust it since it wouldn't have a track record)? Another possibility would be to create a 'code review DAO', which has expert security members. Any DAO could sign up to be linked to this 'code review DAO'.

"Looks like a plan. Better than no plan as before (at least in terms of security). What I miss in the scheme proposed by  /u/vbuterin  is that there is no mention about any prediction tools. One can harvest many found holes, assign many researchers, but still humans can only predict a small fraction of possible situations. There are both tools and possibilities to make prediction apps aimed on finding holes in contracts and codebase. This path should be supported by Ethereum. IMO more than other fields, as identification of threats should precede inventing mitigation techniques, not the other way round. With the rest of points I agree even if it's only an ad hoc plan.",t3_4oqxfd,Hibryda
"Unlike the DAO contract, the EVM/protocol has a formal spec (the yellow paper). If the bug that was used to exploit the DAO was a bug in the EVM implementation (or even if the implementation was correct and the ""bug"" was in the spec), then there would be no controversy about whether or not to fork to apply a fix. I doubt that there would be any philosophizing about what the true ""intent"" was of the EVM spec/implementation. Why is it ""fundamentally complex"" to determine the intent of a smart contract, but straightforward to come to consensus on the ""correct"" definition of the protocol?",t3_4oqxfd,cdetrio

Operating in this environment is not easy. What we are missing - Good programming practices Tools that catch these issues It is not new to programming. There has been a number of 20 year old bugs uncovered in Open Source Software before - all stuff people have been looking at. Programming is not easy.

"the very definition of smart contract theft or loss, is fundamentally about differences between implementation and intent. > Proceeds to describe ways to mitigate  bugs  and  security issues It's obvious that a bug can be described as an inconsistency between implementation and intent. But ""intent"" in the context of contracts is a completely different thing from a bug in a contract (e.g. a misprint or spelling mistake), which in a court, can be nullified in the case of clear intent. So it's extremely misleading to start conflating programming bugs with the concept of contractual intent.",t3_4oqxfd,floor-pi
"Considering a human belief system as formal as it gets like arithmetics can't be completely and consistently encoded in a formal logic system, as per Gödel's Theorem, and formal logic systems have direct equivalence with computer programs, as per Curry–Howard correspondence, it is impossible to code a complete and correct contract system to arithmetics. If not arithmetics, let alone try to encode human moral and value system into smart contracts, which are not even formalized, but if it were, would certainly be much more complex than arithmetics, rendering it impossible to codify, too. But the blog post goes waaay ahead of what actually hit theDAO, and it is not that the relatively simple governance DAO rules imposed any practical difficulty of being formally encoded. The simple truth is that there was a bug, and the code didn't convey correctly the programmer's intent. That would be a verifiable claim if the DAO rules were written down, in English, as an informal specification (mathematically speaking), where the real intent could be easily inferred by any person able to read it (except maybe lawyers). The practical problem theDAO faced, contrary to the probably impossible problem of conveying human values to computer programs, is perfectly tractable, and can be hugely mitigated by using a functional programing like Haskell.",t3_4oqxfd,lcvella

"Ethereum has never been about ""code as contract"".  Ethereum (and all blockchains) are about distributed CONSENSUS.  Blockchains are simply a practical solution to the Byzantine General's Problem.  They solve that problem by allowing untrusting parties to still reach consensus on a state.  What they DON'T do, and never have and never will do, is prevent TRUSTING parties from coordinating to arrive at consensus.  When the majority of miners interests are so aligned that they can trust each other to act in a coordinated way, then whatever they agree to IS Nakamoto consensus.  This is not a bug, it's a built-in feature.",t3_4oq1mm,Anonpic
"This is total garbage and you know it.  First, the hard fork doesn't require consensus, it only requires a slim majority.  There's a huge difference between consensus and 51%.  Second, if Vitalik announced at every press conference:  ""at any given time, 51% of the network may decide to transfer ethereum assets from one party to another, at their whim, and this is a feature"" would anyone ever invest in ethereum? Let me repeat this:  you're claiming that the ability of 51% of the network to transfer ethereum from one party to another at their whim is a feature.  Do you realize how stupid that is?  What prevents your claim from being reality is the culture.  Let's use bitcoin as an example.  The bitcoin community believes that a hard fork to transfer assets against the wishes of many bitcoiners constitutes an attack on the network and a destruction of the social contract.  As a result, if it happened that 51% of full nodes hard forked to transfer assets, the value of bitcoin would immediately collapse and all would be hurt.  This negative economic incentive prevents (or at least very strongly discourages) such an attack.  If such an attack occurs in ethereum with no negative economic consequences, it will be clear that ethereum has no such safeguard.",t3_4oq1mm,failwhale2352
"Nakamoto consensus is, by definitions, 51%.  It's simply how Blockchains work.  It's very well known that 51% of hashing power can do whatever the hell they want, and that this is a baked-in-the-cake feature of blockchain technology.  And yes, people have invested in Ethereum despite this.  Maybe even in part because of it. It's not ""culture"" or a ""social contract"" that protects us.  That's bullshit.  It's the financial incentives built into the whole system.  It's game theory.  If 51% of mining power acts in a way that the market perceives benefits the ecosystem, the value is preserved.  If not, it diminishes, potentially to zero.  Your contention is that protecting DAO token holders against a malicious attack undermines market confidence in the system.  I contend the opposite.  Time will tell, I suppose.",t3_4oq1mm,Anonpic
"I totally agree with part of your comment - indeed it's game theory.  But the game theory relies on the ""culture"", and by culture I just mean the responses of other participants and potential participants.  Whether a hard fork in which the majority forces their views on the minority is beneficial to the majority depends on the broader world's response to the event.  In bitcoin, such a network attack would be clearly value destroying so it doesn't happen.  You're suggesting we foster a culture in which such an attack is viewed as potentially value creating.  I'm arguing that fostering that environment (in which the game theory optimal solution becomes tyranny of the majority) is one in which ethereum has no future. Consider this analogy: we know that tyranny of the majority can happen in the US.  We know that there could potentially be a constitutional amendment that would, for example, remove the right of blacks to vote.  Such a possibility is baked into our democracy.  Yet, I think most of us agree that such an outcome would be both very bad, and very unlikely.  If it happened, it would not be a ""feature.""  Rather, it would be an unfortunate and unintended consequence of a system that tried to balance many opposing issues.",t3_4oq1mm,failwhale2352
"Great points.  I mostly agree. The difference between blockchain tech and your constitutional amendment analogy is economics.  If the majority of hashing power began acting in a tyrannical way, the value of ether would collapse and they'd be slitting their own throats. I don't think protecting the original intent of the DAO is acting tyrannically.  Rather, it's acting responsibly to protect everyone's interests.  The intent of the DAO was clearly expressed in it's marketing material, and it wasn't ""code is law"".  Rather it was to raise funds to support start-ups as token holders may vote to do from time to time.  The code was a means to this end.  Had the attacker's exploit been known in advance, would they DAO have raised as much money?  Of course not.  Likely none.  The exploit was simply a mistake.  An obvious error.  When a majority of miners act to rectify obvious errors and honor original expectations, they build confidence in the system.  To NOT correct such mistakes would be to completely undermine confidence in the system, for the day when people will be willing to invest their money assuming that a software program has ZERO unintended exploits is far, far away.  Virtually all software, despite being vetted retreated has unintended exploits.  We can't let these exploits become the ""final authority"" or Blockchains will be completely useless.",t3_4oq1mm,Anonpic
"""We can't let these exploits become the ""final authority"" or Blockchains will be completely useless.""  I disagree.  The alternative is  to instill in people that they're responsible to mitigate the risks of bad code.  Why is the DAO exploit a crisis?  Because 13% of all ether was poured into a completely new and untested smart contract.  Had it only been 0.1% of ether, this would be a non-issue.  People would lose a little money from the experiment, and then write better code going forward.  Coding is and must be an iterative process.",t3_4oq1mm,failwhale2352
"I'm not so sure.  Even if the amount at stake was orders of magnitude smaller, the problem would be the same:  All code of any length has errors/bugs.  Without some means honoring original intent, people will never be confident putting money into DAO's and the like.  Even a small irrecoverable loss would significantly undermine confidence in all future DAOs, even those that might be perfectly coded.  After all, maybe there is, like this time, some unforeseen exploit.  Regardless, you make a good point in that we can't expect ""forking"" solutions every time there's bad coding.  That's get's unweidly and impossible with thousands or millions of smart contracts running eventually.  So...Maybe you are right after all.  In the end, there may be no other practical solution than to let code strand and fall on its own.",t3_4oq1mm,Anonpic

"Ethereum is at a stage of development where it can afford to fork. It's still an experiment (as said by the creators). It's still developing and does not even have PoS yet.

You don't improve society by hiding behind technical idealism. It takes some pragmatism to fix real life problems. I have yet to read any concrete explanation of the danger of forking at this point of Ethereum's life. Reputation risk? The mainstream will never know what a hard fork is. But they will know and remember that 250M USD were lost and the community chose to not recover them. That's your real danger of lost of trust and reputation. Not to mention leaving behind 15% of the community that participated to the most exciting and daring experiment on Ethereum yet.  Was it naive? Yes.

"This is a common misunderstanding. Broadly speaking, and in a technical sense, accepting an update that censors a behaviour on the network (e.g. attacker withdrawing stolen funds) is no different to accepting an update that adds an ability (e.g. multi-sig). A network that cannot modify itself in this way is a network that cannot adapt. What is being debated as a solution to the DAO attack is possible today because (a) the ethereum network is young so its stakeholders are few and socially connected; and (b) the DAO attack is not only an individual risk, but a systemic one. This means that the system as a whole has an incentive to assume some of the burden of the DAO failure and has the means to coordinate. Choosing not to take the soft/hard fork solution because we would rather believe it is not possible would just be pretending the network is something that it isn't... yet. This solution to this problem would probably not be possible in Bitcoin today because of its relative maturity. Not a perfectly analogous example but, imagine a successful  hand wave  quantum computing attack that magically creates bitcoin in an address. I'm sure the bitcoin network stakeholders would be able to agree on a hard fork to invalidate that address. The goal is apolitical money. The experiment is underway. Let's not fool ourselves into thinking we're there yet. Or that we should be.",t3_4oq1mm,inviolinable
"That's just not true. Ethereum is still young and an experiment. Forking now will have limited impact. Forking later may be very hard (if that's what you wish for?) because miner consensus will always get harder to reach. Just look at Bitcoin, they couldn't fork if their life depended on it (and it kind of does). Actually, forking might even become technically impossible in the future. Like I said Ethereum is young and not even operating in its definitive mining mechanism. The current situation is recoverable, precisely because Ethereum is still developing and agile. Refusing to fork now to fix the situation is like refusing to tweak a prototype and hoping it will work well when mass produced.",t3_4oq1mm,BGoodej

"Stand back for a minute and look at the whole picture. 20000 persons put 135 millions USD in a contract that had been reviewed by the brightest minds in the community (not only slock.it). Yet, the funds were stolen. Just look at these fact from a mainstream point of view. Can a contract be trusted on the Ethereum platform if this is going to happen? No. And you can explain as much as you want to outside people that the contract worked as coded, it won't matter because 130 M USD  went straight from the pockets of investors to the pocket of an robber. Now add another chapter to this story: The community could have recovered the funds but it decided not to do so because even though the contract had a bug, the ""bug was executed as coded"". Do you really think anybody will want to have anything to do with Ethereum after that? The other alternative is forking (which mainstream has no idea what it means anyway) and recovering the funds. That story would bring way less damage to Ethereum's reputation in the mainstream. And from a technical point of view, Ethereum is still an experiment, it's still developing, growing pains are to be expected. We're not even in at PoS yet, Ethereum is not a final product, it is a long way from being ready for wide adoption. Even the fact that a bug like that could remain undetected while the code has been reviewed again and again, audited, and then reviewed some more shows that Ethereum as an ecosystem needs to mature more. So let's not pretend we are bigger than we really are, and cannot adapt. Now is the time to be agile. We don't want to be stuck with unresolved issues down the road.",t3_4oq1mm,BGoodej
A hard fork will not destroy ethereum. It will cause this DAO to be nothing more than a blip in the history of the technology that we can learn from.

If a critical issue with the Ethereum Blockchain or reference implementation is discovered and it has to fork to survive thay is a natural event.

Not all forks are created equal.  This particular one only affects the dao itself and not transactions that have happened outside of the dao.  I think the majority is going to make the choice to freeze and return and I think that is the right thing.

In this particular case and I think history will eventually agree with me that this third party issue as you call it uniquely affected enough people to reach consensus to take this action.

I'm confused. This article from 7 days ago exactly describes the bug and that it was fixed. And 2 days ago somebody uses the same bug. Was it fixed and not deployed? Was it fixed in one place and not another? What am I missing?,t3_4oq1mm,dskloet
"This particular bug was fixed. Fixes don't go live immediately, they would have had to be voted on, so even though it was fixed it was not live. BUT it didn't matter if it was fixed in the live version of the DAO because  it wasn't exploitable  (it required some preconditions in order to become exploitable). So everyone thought the DAO was safe. However, the  same  bug existed in another part of the code that  was exploitable . No one (except the attacker) realized this, so it was neither fixed in theory nor in the live DAO code. The fact that the same bug existed in an exploitable place and it was missed is crazy though. They knew what to look for.",t3_4oq1mm,shouldbdan

"The problem was, I did a ctrl+f for ""call.value"" and I should have done a ctrl-f for "".value("". I've been kicking myself for it ever since we figured out how the hack worked. Even finding that code, it wasn't completely obvious. The problem was in splitDAO which only sends money to a copy of TheDAO's code, which obviously doesn't have the exploit. What I didn't know, since I wasn't all that familiar with TheDAO, is that the split also calls another function, which sends reward money to another address. That wasn't directly a problem because there was no reward money to steal, but the function got called anyway and the attacker used that to call back to splitDAO. (Btw I'm just a random guy who jumped in to help, not a paid auditor or anybody official.)",t3_4oq1mm,ItsAConspiracy

I do think you have to take some personal responsibility for adding money to the DAO as an investment (rather than as an experiment). I promise you that most DAOs in the coming weeks will still have substantial holes, so it's your fault if you lose money.

Last week, Peter Vessenes posted about the recursive call attack on his blog. This was the first time the attack technique was made public. At that time, several of us discussed the attack on one of the developer chats. We looked at TheDAO, but only discovered the vulnerability in the executeProposal method. That one wasn't too bad though because the attack code would have to get through two stages of manual review (whitelisting and voting). This is the vulnerability that Tual was talking about when he posted that article. No funds were at risk because no proposals had been approved yet. The actual attack was on the splitDAO method. The vulnerability there was more subtle, and people just didn't see it.",t3_4oq1mm,ItsAConspiracy

We would first lose 10's of thousands of DAO token holders who would have their ETH stolen be turned off of Ethereum for good. The press and negative PR would be horrible.

This is a fact. Sure, the network does whatever it wants. But I fail to understand how anybody could think that to violate the integrity and true of the ETH blockchain is not opening a precedent. It is exactly that. Doing what is not supposed to be done. Proving the world that you ETH does not represent that that it did when you first got it. Rules can change if someone else messes up. What guaranty will people have that their ETH will not be, for example, made invalid in the future because of reason X? What is the criteria to directly deliberate over the value or even validity of their assets? Ether integrity was  not  compromised today. Why voluntairly destroy it? It is a huge bad precedent. In fact, if ETH holds its strong position today, regardless the unfortunate event, it will prove to be a solid crypt asset. Everybody will have an effective example of how it is worth what it is suposed to and not even dramatic events interfere with that. What better sign of its value do we need? This is a huge oportunity to show ETH reliability. As for the DAO, well, it was after all not reliable. Let's accept that, put the feelings asside and move on.

We are simply returning the original funds that were stolen to their rightful owners.  The bank will still be held accountable for the security lapse as customers likely will not trust them to hold the deposits in the future.

"My gf wrote a book on financial markets and included a section on massive ""fat finger"" market mistakes. Banks have lost millions and billions because of idiotic mistakes. People type in the wrong numbers in their computer, slip and hit some keys. One guy's keyboard got stuck and submitted thousands of orders into the market. Knight Capital lost $400M in 1 hour due to a software bug and went bankrupt. Not once did the exchange or government fix things for them. The banks now have elaborate safety systems to reduce these kinds of mistakes. (Still, Goldman lost $100M in 2013 because of a bug) Exchanges also have an array of safety systems. If Ethereum wants to play with the big boys, everyone should accept this loss as a learning experience and start building safer software. This means Ethereum should have safety protocols built into the network, and contracts should be designed with aggressive safety features. When you cross this line and do a soft or hard fork, you will certainly lose credibility with the finance community.

These two notions took bitcoin through bug after bug during its bumpy launch; the community would decide to act when the intended execution of the protocol did not match the real world outcome.” —  https://blog.ethcore.io/attack-on-thedao-what-will-be-your-response/",t3_4oj7ql,amerinsyd
I support the soft fork option.  The consequences of the alternative are drastic.  Any soft fork will be adopted by the community for the community and deployed in a decentralized fashion as that is the way it works.  Tired of hearing about all this nonsense about how it would be a 'bailout' and how it's a centralized decision that undermines the network... so not true.

If cant negotiate or hacker stubbornly dies before returning Ether , incompetent DAO administrators accept blame, recommend against hard fork, and encourage investors to take full responsibility for where they invest their money in the future.

And if some proposal of forking for a similar case in the future happens, they can decide what to do then.

"I have never wrotten anything here but this time i feel that i have to. I fully support forking and what Vitalik has said. Mainly because: Bitcoin took 1 and half years before the price started to recover After Mt. Gox hacking. Even today it has not reached its former heights. Can we risk the Ethereum price to go down for the following year due to the DAO hack? Ethereum has smart contracts. Many startup investors invest in Ethereum not because they like Ether, but because they like smart contracts. If this theft wont be resolved by community in the best way for DAO token holders then the story will turn out much more unpleasant in the end. Therefore future investments in Ethereum smart contracts may decline for very long time due to the bad karma and grief that will continue for years to come. Forking under these circumstances is no threat to Ethereum comparing to the Bitcoin MtGox story repeating again with The DAO. Forking was done with Bitcoin in early days as well and nobody seemed caring about it until now. It's easy to come to conclusion that the best long term way to overcome the crisis and make media forget this incident is to fork and recover the stolen Ethers versus letting another Mt. Gox story to happen. Community can make the positive change out of this story. Unlike the Bitcoin community which has been divided facing some of recent problems, the Ethereum community can show solidarity to face the threats for its own interests for long term growth and own safety.",t3_4oj7ql,gdruva

Does the Ethereum foundation really want to open this can of worms? The attacker is an asshole, but I think they also did this community a favour by teaching them an important lesson when the stakes were not very high.

Pretty sure this just secures the remaining 70%.  I don't think there's a feasible way to retrieve the stolen 30%,t3_4p5zk9,DeviateFish_
"I don't think there's a feasible way to retrieve the stolen 30% Right.  And that's still a  huge  problem in my, and I'm sure, many other peoples' book. How can we possibly go into PoS with a malicious actor holding a massively disproportionate amount of ETH  relative  to all the rest of the network participants. On top of that, the rest of the network participants had to at least  honestly  participate in the ecosystem either via mining and/or directly purchasing their ETH, thus directly  adding value  to said ecosystem. The attacker did not have to do  any  of that, yet he is going to have a  potentially massive  influence in PoS.  :|",t3_4p5zk9,[deleted]
"You're arguing against POS. Think about it. Money is fungible.  If someone hacks Mt. Gox and steals BTC, they can convert that into a huge ethereum stake.  If someone steals cars or is a hedge fund insider trader, or an arms trader or robs a bank, or whatever, they can take their stolen money and buy ethereum.  There's no way to stop thieves from buying 10% of ethereum.",t3_4p5zk9,asdoihfasdf9239
Exactly this. There is nothing to stop a bad actor taking over a large percentage of the network. PoS isn't workable.,t3_4p5zk9,Bunglesmith
There's nothing to stop them from buying up the same proportion of hashpower in PoW.,t3_4p5zk9,ArticulatedGentleman

"The solution is simply to write the PoS algorithm such that good verification behaviour is rewarded and bad verification behaviour is punished.

The point of pos is that every actor is ASSUMED a bad actor,t3_4p5zk9,3rdElement

Totally fair!,t3_4p5zk9,maxi_malism
There is also the extraBalance account.  My guess is that it won't be drained by the whitehat attack.,t3_4p5zk9,paleovanguard
"Actually, this isn't true.  You can successfully retain the vast majority of funds without even owning the child of the current DAO.  You'll eventually need to own a child of one of these DAOs, yes, but not immediately.  If you own tokens, you can always split. [E] Oh were you referring to the ""dark"" child? In that case, given the nature of the counter-attack, it's actually not wise to try to buy into that child with the intent of attacking it.",t3_4p5zk9,DeviateFish_
"it's actually not wise to try to buy into that child with the intent of attacking it. Can you expand on this? What's the issue with doing that?

"Basically, it boils down to the fact that the only way to obtain tokens in the child DAO is to send it ETH (through the proper channels). Because one party (""the attacker"") already owns an overwhelming majority of the tokens, he can easily flood you out of any splits from his child DAO, by double-spending his tokens in a repeat attack. The only way to even have a chance of countering this is to own more than 10% (-ish) of the tokens in the child DAO (necessitating a deposit of .39M+ ETH)  and  be able to call  splitDAO  on the first split proposal before the attacker. Given that that is essentially a race condition, you also stand to lose that 10%-ish investment and add it to the attacker's haul.",t3_4p5zk9,DeviateFish_
"Hmm, do you think it's better to just hard fork, than to risk an additional .39M+ ETH?",t3_4p5zk9,dezrambson
"This is a tough question. One the one hand, I'm rather philosophically opposed to hard- or soft-forking to cover for an error in the DAO. On the other, valid concerns have been raised about PoS with a single entity controlling so much stake. I definitely don't think it's worth risking giving them even more ETH under any circumstances, given how savvy they seem to be, especially about game-theory type things.  They'd understand they still have the upper hand, and would probably ensure they were the first to call  splitDAO  in that race.",t3_4p5zk9,DeviateFish_
I'm assuming at this point that the soft fork will happen. Wouldn't this  allow us to try the counter attack without risking the attacker actually receiving any funds and/or the additional funds required for the counter attack? The only issue would be the possibility of additional ETH being burned should a hard fork not go through.,t3_4p5zk9,dezrambson
"I haven't seen a plausible soft-fork-only plan to recover the funds from the child DAO.  The soft-fork I'm aware of would only lock the funds in place... which, as implemented, would actually lock the funds of the ""light DAO"", as well, since it would block the movement of ETH to/from any DAO 1.0 contract.",t3_4p5zk9,DeviateFish_

"It really ought to take forking off the table, IMO. And then an official stance on how these sorts of situations are going to be handled in the future ought to be taken by the mining pools, the solo miners, and the Foundation, so we know what to expect when this happens again and we don't end up having to go through this kind of community trauma a second time.",t3_4p5zk9,ryepdx

"How would a fork alienate the user base or betray a social contract? The miners are deciding, not some central authority.",t3_4p5zk9,pretendperson
"Yeah, the miners are deciding, which is within the technical limits of what Ethereum is capable of. Ethereum, like all PoW coins, is essentially a ""miner-ocracy."" So it's not a centralized decision, but it  is  counter to what some non-negligible of people here signed up for. Primarily I'm talking about the expectation that the execution of smart contracts would not be interfered with, barring a critical bug in the Ethereum platform itself. (I use the word ""bug"" here in its true, technical sense, not in the sense of ""Solidity has a bug because it lets me write dangerous code!11!1"") For good or ill, the blockchain structure was conceived of as a platform for uncensorable transactions. That's the expectation many users, especially those from Bitcoin, brought in with them, and the rhetoric around Ethereum only reinforced that expectation. Nothing was communicated to indicate that it would be otherwise, and there was really no reason to expect it to be otherwise. I'd be the first to tell you not to trust implicit messages in the crypto space, but this is one hell of an implicit message to violate. Regardless of whether or not people should have been making assumptions, it's going to feel like a betrayal.",t3_4p5zk9,ryepdx
"Well, somebody has to write the core software and somebody has to run it. It's pretty fucking hard to get a ton of people to agree on ANYTHING so this is and is pretty likely to remain an isolated occurrence. It is rare that something that is this big of a threat to the platform should require any intervention by the masses, and if/when it does happen it's likely to be in the very early days, as in this case.",t3_4p5zk9,pretendperson
"Fair enough. This is going to alienate some people, regardless. Might turn out that it's a net positive as it draws in other people who were gun-shy about trying to write bug-free code. We'll see how it plays out.",t3_4p5zk9,ryepdx

Expectations around Ethereum were that it would act just like any other blockchain, immutable and  predictable.  Forking at all is not preferable. A soft fork is not required. The  whole point  of Ethereum was to let the code be the agreement. You said so yourself, remember? Yes, we  can  fork if we get the miners to agree to it. Technically we're governed by the miners, as you've just said. But doing so is a violation of Ethereum's social contract with its users. If this  had  been the plan of action in the event of a failure such as The DAO's, that  should  have been clearly communicated to the users beforehand. This feels like a betrayal of everything that had been communicated up until The DAO investors got burned. I could understand the pragmatic arguments behind the move before, but if  now  we're talking about hard forking or letting your investors take an immediate 30% loss, well... your investors making a positive ROI not as important as Ethereum, IMO.",t3_4p5zk9,ryepdx

there is a big difference between organic growth spikes and pump/dump,t3_4vkpa1,DaSpawn
"Well, what is the criteria for distinguishing them? Is it simply what does not dump must not have been a p&d?",t3_4vkpa1,sfultong
"technological capabilities and future support/usage by majority/main developers ETC did not exist until people decided to take over the abandoned city and give it temporary ""value"" where none existed (value brought in by hopes/dreams/blindness rather than real world future usability and value brought by dapps running on the most secure and stable chain ETH is the continuation of the city as it was without the ""nuke"" at the center (attacker/thief) that will certainly detonate in some way when moving to POS (or even before when they can access stolen ETC in ~40 days). Zealots will keep ETC alive just long enough to allow them to cash out (if even that long, hard for people to keep selling BTC to pump the fantasy ETC)",t3_4vkpa1,DaSpawn
"Dapps? Oh, you mean those roulette/ponzi/pyramid/cloudmining contracts? Yeah, real loss. You do realize that most of the whole platform is almost exclusively based on speculation on both ETC and ETH and whatever value the dapps hold in the platform won't really matter right now.  Whatever value the dapps hold will be shown in the future. But guess what value is considered right now? The fundamentals of the platform. This is the biggest single selling point for ETC. ETH has made it's choice. It's now confirmed itself that it is solely for protecting the investments for their biggest investors on the platform and have rejected immutability. They can't go back to that now, and whatever these characteristics is worth the market will decide. Whatever characteristics that will be added to the Ethereum platform (ETH/ETC) that involve immutability will probably be added on to ETC or forked, if it survives. Whatever choices ETH chooses, will involve what their investors and foundation are interested in, if it survives.",t3_4vkpa1,lte13
"You have a point, we can only truly know if it was P&D after the dump. Though a meteoric rise in a week when fundamentals haven't changed is almost certainly from pumping speculation, IMO.

"ETC-pumpers have much greater incentive to come to the Ethereum subreddit than the ETH-pumpers have to go to the Ethereum Classic subreddit because the Ethereum subreddit is larger.

Prior the fork there was a few with valid points of argument and mostly civil. As soon as poloniex dropped etc we have seen a sudden influx of almost extremist support for etc . This brings me to think it's not so much about the purity of the chain but the greed involved .,t3_4vkpa1,Wbe4ever
"I've been here through the whole thing and I think you've got rose-tinted glasses. It was not a civil period of debate before the fork, or even between fork and Poloniex. There was a steady drumbeat of ""fork now! Fork hard!"", accusations that anyone anti-fork was pro-thievery, preemptive declarations that the fork was the majority and everyone else should just shut up, and so forth. As a fork opponent it was a wearying, wearing slog. I was happy when the fork happened because I thought perhaps it would finally be over. It's basically just continued, though.",t3_4vkpa1,FaceDeer
"It's not true. There were very nicely reasonable posts against the HF. And they got upvoted. The only thing I can rememeber, which can be somehow described as ""Fork now!"" was a reaction to a time pressure. We had namely dead-line. The fork had to be implemented till specific date before it would become too much complicated. One can of cause argue or speculate if the outcome now is more difficult to handle or not. However, it's good always to remember. To be smart in hindsight is very easy. To be innovative and push the development is always the hardest part. So, I don't see any real reason to blame anyone for anything we decided to do as a community. We've done what we wanted, we learned (and still keep learning). That's the key in innovation.

I did not say that everyone who is criticizing the hard fork now was silent about it before. What I said was that the volume of criticism has increased substantially post hard fork which is not what you would expect if the majority of the critics were motivated by principles.,t3_4vkpa1,aminok
It appears to be a normal reaction to the greed fueled bailout. People aren't happy and I bet word hasn't even fully spread yet. It took me 12-18 hours to switch my hash rate over to ETC and previously didn't even know they were actually going to RUIN the block chain by altering the outcome of a transaction which has already begun the settlement process on  what was supposed to be an always immutable ledger. It's implied that a block chain is immutable because I don't think creator would ever have thought anyone would be so dense as to interpret this differently.,t3_4vkpa1,akstunt600
"The debate around the HF has been all over the news for weeks. Anyone following Etehreum would have heard about it long before it was executed.

This is correct. Not only that but if ETC did become dominant the Ethereum Foundation would still have its endowment so it could continue development on that chain.

Likewise the stigma of ETH among traders and in other cryptocurrency spheres is very strong and to think that their investments aren't a large part of the price of ETH is nuts.

Poloniex are an exchange whose business it is to trade crypto. You can't simultaneously claim there's room for multiple cryptos then get grumpy about a genuine ethereum alternative.

Far worse is lots of people claiming ethereum is under attack and having a go at exchanges. You want to know what hurts the crypto ecosystem?

This a about it: miners already have to verify if a transaction is made by the real owner of the private key, And only the people with the attackers private key can execute the blackhat attack Why dont we interfere in that stage of the process, and say, attacker private key != valid, from the softforked miner point of view, it should not introduce additional ddos problems They can only execute a DAO operation from the address that currently holds their DAO tokens. The whole reason the dao attacker can steal the funds, but not some random bystander, is because the Dao attacker has the privatekey to the wallet address controlling the dao tokens in the darkdao. If we make a softfork that temporarily ignores all transactions made by this wallet address it prevents them from doing the attack. And the whitehats can now use the same exploit against them to recover the funds (Because the whitehats also have dao tokens in those daos). This will not introduce the same ddos attack vector because it does not require the validator to parse the code before rejecting the signature. It will have the same result as when a transaction with a genuinely invalid signature is broadcasted, such a transaction also removes no gas from any wallet.",t3_4qabz9,oneaccountpermessage
Peter responded to this. It may cause the blacklisting of mining pool payouts and other unintended consequence.

But could we not make sure we always win this race by preparing the transaction ahead of time, and coding the ethereum client of the miner to include the whitehat transaction in the first possible block, always before a possible blackhat one. That way the attackers funds are basically just as frozen as in the original softfork scenario right? We could even have miner reject blocks (in the unlikely event) that included the blackhat transaction before the whitehat transaction.

Obviously two months and $250k was not enough, but it was probably among the most responsible contract code that has been deployed on chain thus far.

"Alex, Overall, this is an interesting idea. I also like that you also wrote the contract code for this. I think we can consider something like this for future voting. However, in my opinion, there are concrete issues with the current version of the idea, which is why it's not getting as wide of a support as it could. Namely, its results will not be representative of the Ether holders opinion - because you are simply excluding the DAO Token Holders from voting. You say that their Ether was not directly accessible for them anyway, however, as you may realize, this is not exactly accurate. These individuals, although a lot of them may have been simply profit seeking without any regard to Ethereum, nevertheless have already shown their commitment to Ethereum and to the long-term holding. From the day one, we all knew that it would take at least 40 days to take your Ether out from the DAO. Nevertheless, these individuals have put their Ether into that contract. Note that they have surrendered their ability to sell Ether quickly. Secondarily, the statement that their Ether was not accessible to them any way also does not reflect the whole truth. The whole idea of DAO was to invest token holder's ether into potentially profitable ventures, based on a collective voting. So, it's not really as if they have sold Ether for Bitcoins or for gold or whatever. They continued to hold their Ether in a special vehicle. I understand that there are concrete problems with using tokens for voting. However, do note that in my opinion, this is fixable. You can simply accept tokens in addition to Ether for the voting purposes. You can assign certain weight in Ether that community will agree on. 1:40 or whatever. If you don't do that, you simply will not be able to say that Ethereum community decided anything. You exclude a huge percentage of Ethereum holders. And again, these are actually active Ethereum holders - they didn't just buy Ethereum with hopes that the price will rise. They did a step further. Of course we all know how stupid it was to invest so many in such a glitchy contract. However, do you really want to exclude their opinion from the voting results? Lastly, there is another problem, which may or may not be a serious issue. But I don't think that locking Ether in the first place is all that good. Of course, you need to lock them for at least the voting period otherwise people can just send it to another wallet and vote again. However, beyond that, the benefits are not all that clear. Consider the worst case, somebody who speculates currencies, who doesn't care about Ethereum and is just here to make a short-term profit. So what? Why not let this person vote? Basic economic self-interest will prevent this person from voting in a way that would be bad for Ethereum. Because especially for the short-term holder, bad voting results will cause him to lose money on the exchange difference. Then, for healthy ecosystem, people transferring Ether back and forth would actually be a good thing. I mean, I think that this is why inflation was created in the legacy currencies. To encourage people to spend money rather than hold it. If Ethereum holders will spend the money back and forth, invest it into Ethereum projects, it would actually be a great thing. It's only bad when people exchange it for the fiat. However your voting does not make any distinction there. Consider another case - some people may really like Ethereum, but instead of simply holding Ethers they want to invest those money in some blockchain project. Wouldn't you want to actually encourage that? Overall, I don't think there are many existing real-world precedents to what you are proposing. Although real estate is one of the most illiquid investments out there, if you own a house, and city council passes some law that you disagree with, you can still sell your house within a few months or even sooner if you are lucky. That doesn't mean that you will necessary be a dishonest voter. There is simply no drive to vote against everyone's best interests when it runs contrary to your own. Consider that although everyone voting is good for everyone, on the individual level, an investor will not really receive anything back for his votes other than having his Ether locked. That means there is a strong incentive not to vote. However, even if you decide to go forth and everybody uses the contract you have proposed. Then we get results. But what can we say from these results? We can not say it is the consensus of the community, because we will exclude all the Ether holders who decided not to give up their liquidity. It doesn't necessary make them a bad people. They just don't want to lock their Ether for zero profit. But these individuals may still have good ideas for the community, and we should take their opinion in the account. Overall, I'd support a voting mechanism that will not favor one group of people over another and that will give all Ethereum holders equal say. Just like it works in real world with shareholder voting. I hope you do not take my criticism in a wrong way. You are definitely thinking outside the box and Ethereum is lucky to have somebody like you contributing fresh ideas. However, as you understand this is a large project and one small thing can backfire and have unintended side effects, as we have recently saw. Ultimately, I think voting with Ether is a must have and I will be glad if you will be the one involved in making such a system. But such a voting system should be carefully made to carefully extract crowd opinion without creating significant result distortions while letting all stakeholders have a say.",t3_4qabz9,CryptoDao

We could include DTH but it would complicate the contract considerably. I agree in the disincentive for voting that for me is the single biggest issue with this method.,t3_4qabz9,avsa

"I don't think that's fair to say. Ethereum's smart contracts/platform is still in beta and doesn't really have any solid use cases. So most of Ethereums success(marketcap) is mostly contributed to Hodler's and trader's. To disregard one sect of the community is just as bad as marginalizing any other, especially when they add so much value at this current time.",t3_4qabz9,cryptojo3
I don't think that's a right conclusion. What you're basically asking the community is to put thrust in eth and take the full hit of something goes wrong. Some (like me) have already taken a large hit.,t3_4qabz9,Gr8onbekende
Im not saying that. What I'm saying is that if you're a long term holder I want you to vote with your heart but commit to the consequences of your vote. You shouldn't be able to vote for a fork that gets a short term gain and then bail out the next day.,t3_4qabz9,avsa
"I've corrected this around three times already, but you are not committing to the consequences of your vote. You are committing to the consequences of network opinion. If you vote ""no"" and everyone votes ""yes"", when your funds are finally released not only will there likely be a hard fork but you will have assets in a marketplace that is acting contrary to your vote. You're committing to deal with the consequences of any outcome, not necessarily only the one you favor. Please read the rest of my arguments against a locking vote  here , most of which were never addressed / responded to.  The gist: Do you really think a fork would split the community? That would imply there's market demand for more than one fork, which I doubt. And in the small chance there is, why not serve all demand? We can still all be friends and share the same code, modulo one line. Sure some people may leave, but it would be because they had a fundamental misunderstanding of and dissonance about the systems they were dealing with. Anyone who is here for the long haul and felt that strongly would mine on and use their own chain of choice. And lastly, the polls won't predict the outcome in all cases. So we take the same fundamental risks as a hard fork anyway.",t3_4qabz9,AlLnAtuRalX
"I agree everyone is stuck with the consequences of the whole network decision and there probably won't be two networks. That's why we should prefer the option that has less people jumping ship and getting out of the currency, which is why locking makes sense. It's not that I want people to not have their ether accessible, it's that I want people who were willing not to move it in the first place to just use that as a signal to which they prefer.",t3_4qabz9,avsa
Agreed. My current belief is that it should be (ether amount) * (time you want locked) ^ 2 With time being at least one week and at most 1 year. This means 1 ether locked for a year has the equivalent voting power of 2.8k ether locked for a week. Feels like a good balance between patience and wealth.,t3_4qabz9,avsa
Are the coins locked for the winning side only?,t3_4qabz9,jonny1000
The problem with a coin vote is that people can buy loads of Ether for the vote and then sell it after. I wrote a smart contract to do this before I realized:  https://github.com/ethernomad/ethereum-referendum/blob/master/referendum.sol,t3_4qabz9,jbrown_ethereum

I really don't want to lock my coins in any smart contract. We can do a simple coinvote by signing a transaction with no risk.,t3_4qabz9,aakilfernandes
"Simpler way than that even. Just ping a yes/no vote to a contract. At a set time, count the ether in accounts that voted. My other suggestion was just to do the vote twice  (tho actually coins could be moved in-between, so maybe counts would be regular over a time period). PS Thanks for discussing sensibly. I know you're against any fork, it just felt a bit reactive. I appreciate there are good reasons, honestly.

"Considering that the fork is only meant to be a temporary fix to allow more time to either do counter attacks or to implement a hard fork, is the likely cost of an attack really that bad? If miners prioritised transactions with low gas, how difficult would it be for an attacker to create so many transactions as to make miners be significantly starved of CPU power? Don't they have lots of spare CPU power given that PoW is done with GPUs? Isn't it worth at least trying it?

"What about algorithmically blacklisting all ""fruit of the poisoned tree"" that the attacker creates?  Doesn't seem DoS vulnerable or too terribly hard.  Even if the attacker tries to pollute as many legitimate users as possible by transferring darkDAO tokens to them, it will still be a finite number.  Then that number can be compiled, whitelisted.  And once the reverse attacks are completed, the entire soft fork code can be entirely abandoned, with no permanent consequences for the Ethereum codebase.",t3_4qabz9,emansipater
"The whitelist could even be maintained on-chain, allowing for all this to be deployed in a single software update/soft fork.",t3_4qabz9,emansipater
"Hello, thinking about it I think the best fix for the soft-fork ddos problem is: instead of filtering based on code analysis we should simply blacklist/censor the wallet addresses of the known malicious actors in the darkdao's and whitehatDao, this will allow the whitehats to do a exploit-drain-split without the attackers being able to join the split This method will not create the ddos problem, is still a softfork and still allow us to secure the dao funds. This a about it: miners already have to verify if a transaction is made by the real owner of the private key, And only the people with the attackers private key can execute the blackhat attack Why dont we interfere in that stage of the process, and say, attacker private key != valid, from the softforked miner point of view, it should not introduce additional ddos problems A user trying to send transactions with invalid signatures will also not consume gas.",t3_4qabz9,oneaccountpermessage
"You have more pressing matters to think about i.e., the DoS on the soft-fork, but technically speaking I do not think ""if code executes, it must pay for itself"" is something you can enforce 100% of the time i.e., code/program can crash before it pays. Such an attack will look very similar to the current DoS scenario.",t3_4qabz9,muneebali
"Nope, that's what gas is for. If it crashes, the gas it allotted gets paid out automatically. If you can find a way to create a transaction that doesn't pay for its gas, that's a serious bug, and you should show it to the core team(s).",t3_4qabz9,peterborah

"Here's my proposed workaround: Lower the per-transaction gas limit a bit (maybe to about 1 second's computation for a typical full node). If a transaction violates the soft fork rule, don't forward it to any peers. If a peer forwards you a transaction that violates the soft fork rule, ban them.

Sure, maybe YOu won't complain to the SEC if You get a do-over, and you get most of your eth back... but the nature of this debate indicates that view is not unanimous. Furthermore, a hard fork by ethereum is a conviction of theDAO by a jury of its peers as a fundamentally unjust contract.  Which just about guarantees an enforcement action and intervention in every future smart contract! By intervening in this smart contract, we are admitting that intervention is justified.

A smart hacker of course would open their short positions hours or even a day before the attack to make it seem unlikely that it was them if trading logs were ever investigated.",t3_4ou5vm,TommyEconomics
"The only reason the panic happened the first time was because no one knew what was happening. There is no expectation that the remaining eth will remain there now. Plus, anyone could counter attack anyone who attempts to drain further. The advantage the original attacker had was he ended up in a child dao by himself. Many argue that he never expected to be able to access that eth. One could also argue that a further drain would stabilize the markets as it would almost certainly ensure a hard fork would go thru, which is a more stable point that the infighting we are experiencing now.",t3_4ou5vm,insomniasexx

We should fix bugs in contracts, by a fork if necessary. Opposing a bugfix-fork is just callous to users who suffered losses when the contract did not work as intended and as expected. Furthermore, how can we trust smart contracts if we decide not to fix bugs when they are found? We can only trust smart contracts if they are  tamper-proof , which means free from vulnerabilities. The idea that tamper-proof means bugs can't get fixed is ridiculous!

PoS is far more integral to the future plans for Ethereum than some principle of never forking because ... Satoshi. You are thinking like a bitcoiner. PoS is the mechanism by which all the economic activity (including dapps and DAOs as opposed to just payments) generates fees which are shared with token holders. It is what gives ETH an underlying value. It is completely foreign to what bitcoin is about, but central to what ethereum is about. It is part of  what makes ethereum complementary to btc rather than a competitor for the payments market.",t3_4onvxf,LGuappo
"I admit that I don't understand PoS. I do understand PoW. Don't patronize me. Explain it to me. I'm all ears. I have a degree in Computer Science. I'm an ether miner and hodler. I'm also a BTC (former miner and) hodler. I don't like this narrative that everyone that is against forking to reverse the theft is some kind of bitcoin maximalist or whatever. I am not against forks. Forks after all are an emergent property of the protocol by virtue of miner consensus. I am for increasing the BTC block by fork. Your post did nothing to explain anything. It was without substance. Things seem to work with PoW right now. Fees are generated. ETH already has an underlying value. Why is PoS necessary? Again, I admit that I haven't followed that train of discussion that closely. Is it simply to free up resources to execute the VM?",t3_4onvxf,samplist
"If I got you wrong, I apologize. Think of it like this. BTC has whatever value people assign to it in the markets. ETH, with PoS, represents a portion of the value of the entire network, a platform for commerce (commerce writ large, not just payments but also the fees paid by dapps and irl businesses for a piece of the processing power of the Ethereum virtual machine). To put it another way, through PoS ETH tokens generate a dividend based on the total value of all ethereum-based commerce and the token's value is in that way more similar to the value of a dividend-yielding stock than it is to the value of a straight currency. With PoS ETH has this intrinsic value as dividend-yielding device plus whatever value markets assign it as a currency. If PoS were taken off the roadmap there would no longer be a mechanism for token holders to receive a share of the economic activity of the network so the value proposition of the token would be fundamentally altered in a way that makes it more like a bitcoin clone and less like a novel creation. Also (and as a computer scientist you would be better able to understand the devs' explanations than I am) I understand that PoS is a necessary technical building block to plans to make ETH massively (and, eventually, infinitely) scalable. So for all of those reasons PoS is not something that people who are seriously invested in Ethereum are going to want to just toss aside so we don't have to disappoint some crypto-anarchist ideologues.",t3_4onvxf,LGuappo
"If PoS were taken off the roadmap there would no longer be a mechanism for token holders to receive a share of the economic activity of the network I'm not an economist, so maybe this question is naive, but why should they? What's the real world value of holding and staking? Seems like it incentivizes gumming up the network with tokens locked up in staking contracts. ETH locked up in staking isn't doing other valuable things. (It is my understanding that this is why a lot of the developed world's central banks are inching towards negative interest rates, to try to keep money flowing and our economy going).

In exactly the same way the people in PoW don't want to much power with a single miner/pool, people in PoS don't want too many tokens in a single set of hands. I'm not proposing every time someone steals any amount of ETH there needs to be a fork.

The point of a PoS system is that power resides in the hands of those with something to lose.  The more you have to lose, the more influence you have on the system.  It's explicitly an implementation of the ""golden rule"" - he who has the gold makes the rules.  The bugfinder now has something to lose, it's his choice to throw it away or use it maliciously if he wants.  Some people may be dickholes, anarchocapitalistic systems have to be able to take that into account. Now, it's also inevitable that people end up with concentrated ownership of PoW systems too.  I remember  back when one mining pool had a majority of hash power  - they voluntarily decided to split, but they didn't  have  to.  And some of the Chinese enterprises represent single entities rather than conglomerates of miners, they have no reason to split and big incentives to exploit their power.

"Apple to oranges.

All 8, plus the innumerable coders that reviwed the code (7000 members on their slack last time i checked) all missed the issue, even after being told it existed and reviewing the code endless times. This lot included Vitalik Buterin himself. Those that called it a 'newb' error couldn't be further from the truth and were motivated by either malice or greed (speculators). A fork made sense to technically minded people, because the inventors of the language had done goofed. In this case, the error is bad security on a private company's github account.

Its one of the first things I thought when I entered the world of Ethereum some month ago. So I´m completely with you. I think it would have a very deep forward impact on crypto and Ethereum! Swiss basic or direct democracy was already mentioned by you and Pannota and thats what I intended, too. BUT there is a serious problem considering the technical process of voting: What will be considered as a vaild vote? Shall there be a pure coin-voting as some have proposed, lately? It would be an easy an elegant way, but IMHO leading to centralizaion and oligarchy of the ETH-rich very quickly. Shall there be a wallet-voting? But how to identify 1 person = 1 wallet (if we want that) or do we accept that we will never know how many wallets are behind a person = multi-wallet-voting? Shall we put up some soft conditions to restrict and hinder multi-wallet-voting and the power of coin-voting, e.g. by setting a max. ETH amount of e.g. 50 ETH needed in a voting wallet and other cross-restrictions? That would be easier to implement, far more fair than coin-voting, but still allow cheating to some extend. Of course an external source could be set up for voting with an identifying process, but thats centralizaition (the voting-server) again, which we didn`t want in the first place. There would be no problem if there would be an identifying process (1 person = 1 vote) and I think a good number of people have no problem identifying themselves to be able to vote. But whats with those who want to stay anonymus? A kind of biometric approach could solve the anonymus-voting  problem. Lets say we combine a short sentence you speak as a stored audio file with a scan of your venes at your wrist(or anywhere else you like). For voting on a actual matter you need to speak your sentence again and scan you venes again. Important would be a validation-process of the sentence and venes AND the freshness due to the variation of the moment. Means a stored copy wouldn`t pass. It would probably improve the rate of 1 person = 1 vote, but still could be fooled. There are other questions, too: Who is allowed to vote? Shall there be rules for who can vote?

"There was no rollback. There were some ETH sitting in a specific contract, that due to the conditions of the contract couldn't be moved for a month or so. The fork added an extra state change (think of it like an extra transaction that wouldn't normally be allowed) that moved these ETH from that contract to another contract. A more interesting question with tokens is what's going to happen when someone needs to fork not the entire blockchain, but a specific individual token. In principle if the users of the token agree, you can simply deploy a new contract, set it up with the balances listed in the previous contract and ask everyone to use the address of the new contract instead of the old one. However, weird things will happen if you've got funds controlled by another contract, like a betting contract or a decentralized exchange: The contract ends up owning funds in the new token contract, but it may not know who they belong to or what to do with them.

I think a really important point is that the community should create new platforms to participate and share knowledge.

"Agreed. This is  /r/ethereum  which is the longest chain from the HF with  significantly  more hash rate. BTW I've seen some people claim recently that the old chain will catch up to the new chain due to the recent hash rate in a few days. This is false and demonstrates a lack of understanding of how often the difficulty is calculated in Ethereum. If the differential between the old chain in the new chain block times is even just 3 seconds in favor of the old chain it would take 90 days to surpass the number of blocks on the new chain. as of this comment the delta is only .3 seconds so we're talking over a year for the old chain to catch the new chain. Can the old chain catchup with the new chain? Sure. But it will take a very long time and a lot of investment. It's very very unlikely. edit: For those looking to learn more about how difficulty works, read Nick's latest post:  https://medium.com/@weka/rise-up-and-break-your-chains-d8e4cc7e6de#.cxa74t7sk",t3_4uidu6,NewToETH

If you guys want to keep using ETC you need to change the nonce behavior.,t3_4uidu6,huntingisland

"I think Vitalik is suggesting that ETC should hard fork and change its nonces so all the replays stop. Would also be good to change the handshake a bit so ETC and ETH clients stop talking to one another and relaying transactions to the wrong network. If ETC intends to be a real project, I think you guys should go ahead and do this ASAP.",t3_4uidu6,huntingisland

Where was your ""decency"" when you were ask to vote for returning the DAO funds? Live by the sword, die by the sword. And I say that without any hostility toward ETC. A hardfork is part of the game. Picking a chain is part of the game. Each chain comes with its particularity. ETH does not have to fix ETC's problems. ETC's proponent should step up and do it.",t3_4uidu6,BGoodej

"I don't find it to be a problem, its a larger problem for ETH, and they already split from the existing network. It makes no practical sense to make this change.

What? ETH has the problem too. It's a replay attack. It can go either way.,t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf

"Exactly, so why do ETC people care so much about the ETH problem? Here on the ETH side I wish ETC good luck but I could not care less about what happens there.",t3_4uidu6,BGoodej
ETH does not have to care about ETC. ETH just exists and solves its own problems. And so should ETC do.,t3_4uidu6,BGoodej

I think so. Sure there are a few anti-fork people who may still want to support classic but at this point they've had to realize they're in the minority. The rest are people trying to make some point about Hard Forking or those who have financial incentive to try to hurt the Ethereum network. This is very much an attack Ethereum.,t3_4uidu6,NewToETH
"I don't think so at all. Obviously without being a mind reader you can't really say for sure... but that goes for both of us. Given folks would naturally be rather secretive if their true purpose was to be dastardly and destroy Ethereum somehow, I don't know how you judge the majority of ETC supporters fall into this group. I'm at least one ETC supporter that is doing so based on principle. I'm not against forks - that's idiotic and I've seen nobody in ETC claiming otherwise - I'm against forks to fix user errors. Protocol changes are a completely different story.",t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf

I see no reason why a properly-implemented PoS fork wouldn't go similarly. And if it doesn't, the DAO-rescue fork of Ethereum will face a split too. There's no difference between the protocols the two forks are using so if PoS is a problem for the users of one it's likely to be a problem for the users of the other.",t3_4uidu6,FaceDeer

Someone please tell them",t3_4uidu6,TommyEconomics
"Everybody knows about the difficulty bomb (well... except you apparently). It was agreed upon since the beginning of Ethereum. People don't have a problem with forking per se, people have a problem with forking for the benefit of a few. And, by the way the upcoming hard fork will not affect immutability of the chain. To be honest, I am shocked that people can take a pro-fork position in this debate without even understanding the basics of Ethereum, like it seems to be your case.",t3_4uidu6,RaptorXP
"I've studied blockchain for thousands of hours, Clearly, I'm not afraid to point out the fact that I don't know everything. I just responded to another poster, by definition, changing, or doing a hardfork, makes a blockchain no longer immutable.  http://www.dictionary.com/browse/immutable I'm well aware that PoS was coming up, I wasn't aware that it was going to be essentially forced. I'm fine with that since I'm a proponent of PoS.

"Despite your thousands of hours of study, I think your understanding of ""immutability"" lacks some nuances. Upgrades to a blockchain's protocol can be performed that do not interfere with the blockchain's state - the recent switch from Frontier to Homestead is an example of such an upgrade. The switch to PoS will be another.",t3_4uidu6,FaceDeer
"By definition, I'm correct, so maybe those who want immutability should use a different word.",t3_4uidu6,TommyEconomics
"Okay, we can skip the word altogether if the semantics are problematic for you. The fact remains that Classic is not opposed to  all hard forks ever of any kind . It is opposed to hard forks that  tamper with the state of the blockchain . It's an important distinction and should put to rest your concerns about Classic not implementing PoS when the time comes.",t3_4uidu6,FaceDeer
"Really? You think all the people talking about immutability mean every single facet of the technology? I suppose that should really extend to new blocks too, right? Surely those people talking about immutability mean we should just sit on the genesis block forever. To mine anything would be to change something! Seriously. This isn't at all about not changing anything ever. It's about maintaining a consistent history where actions that have occurred remain in the history. Notable exceptions can be made for bugs in the technology itself.

"Several things to consider here. DGXFREETX contract would need to tell the exchanges, payment processors, and others to use their contract as the ledger of accounting.  Making deals with other companies costs time and money. DGXFREETX would also need to develop all the peripheral tools and services such as mobile wallets, Point of Sale apps, and other things that DigixCore (and DigixDAO) will be creating for the ecosystem.  These things cost time and money to put together. DGXFREETX would need to create its own network effect of users who will use their ledger.  Marketing and user acquisition costs time and money. I don't see how it's really possible for them to run a service that doesn't have any fees.  There's been this popular belief that you can't create profitable ÐApps because it's easy to copy them and I tend to disagree with that notion.  It's easy to build a search engine that implement's Google's PageRank but you don't see companies even coming close to competing against them.  It's because they have a brand which they have built and that plays a very big role in user acquisition.  Just like with Google and other popular brands, DigixCore and DigixDAO will put significant efforts in building the brand through marketing as well as building great products for people to use.",t3_4c8htn,aedigix
"I'm perplexed by this response because it seems to ignore the standardized token protocol. If your exchange can handle slock.it DAO tokens, freemyvunk tokens, or any other token using the standard token interface then adding one more is drop-in.  Mist is the only wallet needed. Actually if you're doing some custom token that needs its own wallet etc then that's a hindrance and a benefit to the freeDAO tokens. And why would someone do this? It's pretty easy to code and the coder too would avoid fees for himself if the token was widely used. All efforts to build the brand would likewise build the free token since the gold backing it is digix.",t3_4c8htn,x_ETHeREAL_x
"I believe Digix sees itself primarily targeting people that for ideological or economical reasons, want to use gold as a payment instrument. For example in the valuation discussion, they refer to the success eGold  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold  had as a payment system (turnover 28x money base per year), rather than as an investment vehicle (""gold ETF""). For it to function as a payment system, it needs to be fungible, i.e. the unit of account needs to represent the exact same underlying value at all times. So yes, you can perfectly set up your Digix-token holding contract as a gold ETF, and people could even start trading shares in it, but the assumption of the Digix offering is that enough users will want to use it as a payment system with a constant unit of account, and those people will be willing to pay the transaction fees. I am not arguing that assumption is valid...  It's going to be an interesting market experiment and we'll see how things turn out.",t3_4c8htn,cryptopascal

Remember the GLD etf charges a 0.4% management fee to cover storage and profit for the etf.  Owning Gold with digix will be at a much lower cost than through GLD. Maybe you could lower the .13% transaction fee when they get up to scale but whether you are selling gold from vault to pay fees or deducting it from the coins directly, the real issue is how much fees are you actually paying?

He declared that there was only one fair solution: the live son must be split in two, each woman receiving half of the child. Upon hearing this terrible verdict, the boy's true mother cried out, ""Oh Lord, give the baby to her, just don't kill him!""  The liar, in her bitter jealousy, exclaimed, ""It shall be neither mine nor yours—divide it!"" The king declared the first mother as the true mother, as a true, loving mother would rather surrender her baby to another than hurt him, and gave her the baby. King Solomon's judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.",t3_4uidu6,WhySoS3rious
"It was the pro-fork people who were demanding that the baby be split, in this scenario. The anti-forkers, who are now Classic users, didn't want the baby split in the first place. Fortunately it's a tough baby and both halves are still alive.",t3_4uidu6,FaceDeer

This is what could be destroyed, or delayed, if a big noise keeps being made by the ETC supporters (the minority). Incidentally, if there had been no HF at all, ecosystem expansion would have had a set back for sure. A significant portion of the recovered DAO Ether will be invested in the ecosystem, and that would have been lost. Also, if there were no HF, not only would that money not be invested but other money would have been scared away for a while, and would take longer for a new DAO to come into existance.",t3_4uidu6,Zapitnow

I have still not heard anyone explain how this HF would make something else more likely. The whole argument against the HF only boils down to a slippery slope one.,t3_4uidu6,seweso
Partly it is a slippery slope. That can be a valid argument. It's only when used in the extreme that it becomes an issue. I don't see any particular reason to believe that this situation was so extraordinary it could never happen again. Can you honestly tell me you don't think there is a greater chance for ETH to fork for an errant contract in the future than ETC?,t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf
"Partly it is a slippery slope. That can be a valid argument. Nope, you actually need to make your case why the next HF would be easier. And nobody explained that. Seems to me that the cost/benefits would stay exactly the same. No locked coins? Forgetaboutit. Not a large % of coins? Forgetaboutit. No cryptographic proof of a hack? Forgetaboutit. I don't see any particular reason to believe that this situation was so extraordinary it could never happen again. Then you don't understand the situation. Opinions without understanding, isn't that the best thing in life? Can you honestly tell me you don't think there is a greater chance for ETH to fork for an errant contract in the future than ETC? Yes!!! Oh god yes!!! Because it is unlikely that coins are similarly locked, the theft would be as big and the theft would be as evident. New contracts will be small, or bigger contracts will have better emergency features, they would be able to fix themselves. So, in summary: Smaller hacks would not be fixed via HF, bigger hacks would be very unlikely to succeed or need a HF.",t3_4uidu6,seweso
"bigger hacks would be very unlikely to succeed or need a HF. So in other words I was right? In the same post you claim I have no reason to believe another large contract failure would be fixed with a hard fork you suggest large contract failures might be needed to be fixed with a hard fork. Ignoring that, I fail to see how this fork doesn't set a precedent. Future contract failures can point to this incident and ask why they shouldn't get the same treatment in an identical situation. It's naive to expect all future contracts will be so much better secured we'll never see another large scale failure. The error in the DAO wasn't some novel kind of error. The DAO held massively more ETH than the Foundation suggested. Despite having significant funds available, Slock.it never did anything resembling a proper audit for the size of the DAO. This wasn't one small, new failure that can be easily prevented from ever happening again. Having a Turing complete coin is both massively cool and massively risky. Issues will continue to pop up. People will continue to be lax about their own security. Contracts will still gather more attention than they are prepared for. Your argument mostly revolves around contracts getting significantly more secure. I don't believe this is so reliable. Well established companies with lots of capital and lots to lose have repeatedly had security issues in much better known and understood environments. I don't see how we can justify putting so much faith in lean, bleeding edge startups in a complex, relatively unknown environment.",t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf
"So in other words I was right? In the same post you claim I have no reason to believe another large contract failure would be fixed with a hard fork you suggest large contract failures might be needed to be fixed with a hard fork. I did not say completely impossible no, but it is virtually impossible and very very unlikely. So it becomes less likely, and not more likely  after  this successful Hardfork. We are slippery sloping backwards. Future contract failures can point to this incident and ask why they shouldn't get the same treatment in an identical situation. Because who would you ask? Something either makes economic sense or it doesn't. Pretty sure a lot of people will get ridiculed in the near future for even suggesting it while thinking the situations are similar in any way. At least I hope you now understand. The DAO held massively more ETH than the Foundation suggested. Despite having significant funds available, Slock.it never did anything resembling a proper audit for the size of the DAO. That was stupid. But it was very very educational. Lots of excitement for a currency not even a year old. Contracts will still gather more attention than they are prepared for. The DAO contract even had security measures which still worked perfectly fine. If they didn't a Hardfork would not even be possible. ""you've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelette"". I don't see how we can justify putting so much faith in lean, bleeding edge startups in a complex, relatively unknown environment. Then don't put money in them. People are going to loose money again. But I don't expect a new HF to fix any of it.",t3_4uidu6,seweso
This kind of thinking is completely foreign to me. I do not understand how a hardfork now actually makes another hardfork in an identical situation later even less likely than setting the precedent that hardforks are not a solution to this class of problems. What makes you think any of this holds? This class of problems is not solved. There is no general solution to this kind of problem. ETH has now used a hardfork to address this kind of problem once. How is it now somehow even less likely than ETC to use this method to address an almost certain repeat of this issue?,t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf
"I don't think I said the HF itself makes a hardforking less likely. But if anyone considers it less of a success than they anticipated, then that would be true. Hardforking in a similar fashion is already extremely unlikely, because a similar hack where you are actually able to refund people without a lot if economic harm is very unlikely. Furthermore, as the economy grows you simply lose the ability to orchestrate such a thing. I actually can't follow the slippery slope argument. If you like those arguments, how can I ever persuade you?",t3_4uidu6,seweso
"I don't see how a future issue is almost certainly going to cause a lot of economic harm to refund people. That's part of the supposed benefit to the Ethereum hardfork model. It was also possible because of the controls on the DAO, which are widely recognized now as wildly inadequate. Surely future contracts will include controls that are at least as good as what the DAO had. As for the ability of the growing ecosystem to resist such changes in the future... you're right, to a point. One of my major issues with it was that the pools basically ran it. In a environment without pools, a non-vote is a no vote. The vast majority of miners never voted. We can argue however long about voter participation when one side or another is already far ahead, but that's just a lot of speculation. Ultimately the HF was enacted because of the actions of just a few people, and with a very different level of proof than would exist in a system without pools. This is somewhat ironic because Ethereum has included measures specifically to help remove the advantages offered by pools. But this means that a growing ecosystem doesn't really impede future hardforks anywhere near as significantly as might be expected. You can persuade me by showing me that there is something unique about this DAO situation that makes it virtually impossible for it to happen again. Ethereum hasn't changed, at least not beyond that one block. Many individuals still seem happy with the HF. Exchanges have shown they will at least tolerate it. Some businesses are satisfied with it. Pools show no sign of going away. Time will tell what ends up happening, but right now there is no immediate reason I see that makes me think anything about the DAO situation is so unique it cannot happen again. What's changed, beyond the demonstration that ETH will use a hardfork to change a contract?",t3_4uidu6,ergtdfgf

I don't think you guys should have even suggested a fork. To me it looked like after the attack the price was stabilizing around 15-16 dollars and then vitalik mentioned a soft fork and it's been hovering around 11-12 dollars. If I'm right about that second drop the soft fork idea lost ethereum users more value than it has the possibility of saving. Also I think that the ethereum community shouldn't do anything about the failures of third party developers. After all of this though I still think the price will recover so I will probably be buying soon.,t3_4otj3y,AnarchyUnited
"Thanks for your reply. The price actually shot back up to over $17 after vitalik's comments. It was reassuring that all devs were looking at the issue, but really the damage was already done and tons of traders were going to react with leveraged shorts, pushing those who had just bought at the recent highs to dump.

The people investing in a currency (myself included) don't understand it that well and get spooked at every turn, mostly without any real justification. We're all careful with our money. Its like how the Financial Times can end a company simply by publishing a damning report of their chance of success, and then their stock prices plummet, or when they oversell a new technology that will only see any real returns in 50 years like the nanotech investments of the 2010s. Sure they will succeed, but its still a while before we see any real returns. Talk seems to be everything. Its all you've got when you don't have any real data, and because most people invest like that, it's like a a snowball or a pendulum effect, everyone follows everyone else and it goes viral. I just bought a bunch more Ethereum, and have a mining rig being built even with the price plummet. The DAO isn't officially related to Ethereum. It was just a fund put together to help Ethereum based startups. It got broken into and exploited. Its got nothing to do with Ethereum. The Ethereum network is still as secure as its ever been. I'll ride it out whether it will fail or not, I've already pulled the trigger, and reached the point of no return.

The EVM isn't mistreating the DAO code at all, it is running as per the specification. So there is a recursive payout 'problem'? No there isn't. It was all in the specification. When the DAO was fund raising, it was explicit that the only thing that mattered was the DAO's contract code. Nothing else should be taken as being reliable. Well, the contract code is still operating exactly as it was specified. A 'hacker' is merely using the code in ways that were there to see, should anyone have looked. How can they be stealing when they are just using the code? Do you see the problem with 'trustless' contracts now, suckers?
